    "section": "2.1 Game building blocks and examples",
    "text": "2.1 Game building blocks and examples\nIn order to define a game, we typically need at least four elements:\n\nPlayers: who are playing the game (at least two)\nRules: what are the rules of the game, what moves are possible and what are prohibited\nOutcomes: what are the possible results of the games (score combinations leading to a win or a loss, scenario(s) of a draw, etc.)\nPayoffs: the players’ preferences over outcomes\n\nThe objective of each player in a game is to identify strategies that maximize potential payoffs, given what they know about the rules of the game, their opponents, the possible outcomes and their preferences. A strategy is a complete contingent plan telling a player what action to take in every possible situation of the game.\nLet us illustrate these elements via a couple of examples.\n\nExample 1 (Matching pennies)  \n\nPlayers: There are two players A and B\nRules: Each player puts down a coin, either heads or tails up\nOutcomes: Player A wins if the coins match (both heads or tails). Player B wins if the coins do not match.\n\n\n\nExample 2 (Tennis) Let us consider a tennis game in a single tennis tournament (there are doubles and mixed doubles, too). A tennis match typically consists of up to seven sets, each of which consists of several games. We will be considering a single tennis game.\n\nPlayers: two players of the same sex\nRules:\n\nScoring: A game is scored as 15, 30, 40 and game. If both players reach 40, it’s called “deuce.” To win from deuce, a player must win two consecutive points (advantage and game).\nService: One player serves in each game. The server must hit the ball diagonally into the opponent’s service box. A serve that touches the net but lands in the correct box is a “let” and is replayed. A serve is a fault if it lands outside the service box or if the server misses the ball. Two consecutive faults result in a double fault, giving the point to the opponent.\nRallies: After the serve, players rally by hitting the ball back and forth. The ball must be hit before it bounces twice on the player’s side.\nWinning Points: A point is won if the opponent fails to return the ball within the court boundaries, hits it into the net, or touches the net after hitting the ball before the ball lands on the other side of the court, etc.\n\nResults: A single winner by means of the scoring rule (no ties).",

Each player knows every element of the game, namely, the players involved, the strategy in each contingency and the resulting payoff in each situation. In addition, every player knows that the other player(s) know all of this, including the fact that this player knows that they know.",

    "text": "3.1 Normal form\nThe normal form is the representation of a game using a matrix whose columns and rows represent all possible outcomes. It is best used to represent games of simultaneous moves where order of play is not important.\nIn the examples that follow, the first number represents the payoff to the player whose strategies show up on each row of the matrix. The second number reprsents the payoff to the player whose strategies show up on each column.Let us try to determine the best responses and the Nash equilibrium of each game.\n\nExample 3  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeads\n\n\nTails\n\n\n\n\nPlayer B\n\n\nHeads\n\n\n(-1,1)\n\n\n(1,-1)\n\n\n\n\nTails\n\n\n(1,-1)\n\n\n(-1,1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Normal form representation of the game of matching pennies.

If both grow the same crop, they will flood the market with the same good and pushing down the price. The land of the person named Anil is equally suitable for both types of crops (cassava and rice). For the other person, Bala, the land is as good as that of Anil for growing rice, but less so for cassava. The outcome of this situation can be predicted using a simple game theory setupt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRice\n\n\nCassava\n\n\n\n\nAnil\n\n\nRice\n\n\n(4,4)\n\n\n(6,3)\n\n\n\n\nCassava\n\n\n(6,6)\n\n\n(5,2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An agricultural game\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5 Consider a automobile market serviced by two firms, Ford and BMW. If both innovate (for example, introducing new EV models, incorporating AI, etc.), then they will share the market as before but earn lower profits due to the high R&D costs. If one innovates and the other does not, then the market share gained from the former will more than compensate for the high costs and it generates higher profits as a result. If both do not innovate, they continue to earn high profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVueling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovate\n\n\nDo not innovate\n\n\n\n\nEasyJet\n\n\nInnovate\n\n\n(5,5)\n\n\n(10,2)\n\n\n\n\nDo not innovate\n\n\n(2,10)\n\n\n(7,7)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A prisoners’ dilemma game of innovation\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6 Game theory is very much alive in dating. In the simplest scenario, imagine two individuals (the players) deciding how much effort to put into the relationship. If both slack off, they split quickly and move on with no damage done. If one is committed while the other is lukewarm, the one committed ends up paying a higher price and potentially feeling resentful after the split. If both are committed (exerting high efforts), the relationship blossoms and they live happily ever after.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLover A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit\n\n\nSlack off\n\n\n\n\nLover B\n\n\nCommit\n\n\n(7,7)\n\n\n(-2,5)\n\n\n\n\nSlack off\n\n\n(5,-2)\n\n\n(0,0)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A dating game with multiple Nash equilibria\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the differences in the outcomes of these games? Observe that the game of matching pennies in Example 3 does not have an equilibrium. There is always an incentive to deviate from a chosen strategy depending on the choice of the opponent. In Example 4, we have a unique Nash equilibrium that is also Pareto optimal.2 In Example 5, we have a unique Nash equilibrium which is not Pareto optimal: the pursuit of individual interest does not lead to a socially optimal outcome. This is an example of the famous Prisoners’ Dilemma game. In Example 6, we see a situation of non-uniqueness of equilibria.",

    "section": "3.2 Extensive form",
    "text": "3.2 Extensive form\nThe extensive form of the game records not just the outcomes but also the dynamic of the game. For this reason, it is often used to represent sequential games in which the order of play is important. Indeed, taking out the game dynamic and collapsing it into a matrix typically results in too many equilibria, as we see in Figure 6. In particular, the normal form representation provies two equilibria: (In, Accommodate) and (Out, Price War). Nevertheless, if we examine the game in extensive form using backward induction (starting from the end nodes), it is clear that the best response of the incumbent (P2) to the entrant’s “In” is to accommodate. Knowing this, the incumbent would choose to go in. Hence the only equilibrium of the game would be (In, Accommodate). The equilibrium (Out, Price War) is described as sequentially irrational because it is not a NE in the subgame starting from the decision node of the incumbent. In dynamic games, we would like to rule out such irrational equilibria, hence the need for the more refined solution concept of subgame-perfect equilibrium(Definition 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   entrant{P1} --&gt; |In| incumbent{P2} \n   entrant -- Out --&gt; A(\"(0,10)\")\n   incumbent -- Accommodate --&gt; B(\"(5,5)\")\n   incumbent -- Price war --&gt; C(\"(-2,-2)\")\n\n   linkStyle 0 stroke:#111,stroke-width:4px,color:#000\n   linkStyle 2 stroke:#111,stroke-width:4px,color:#000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: An extensive form game with two players, P1 (entrant) and P2 (incumbent).

When a single market is considered in isolation, its equilibrium is a partial one. When all markets are considered, we speak of a general equilibrium. In a pure exchange economy, all markets are markets of consumption goods. In a production economy, the relevant markets include those of factors of production such as labor, capital and land.

One can also verify that the long-run cost function does not have a fixed cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A perfectly elastic long-run supply curve\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2 Suppose we have obtained a convex cost function for the firm of the form: \\[\nC(q) = 0.5 a q^2 + bq + c,\n\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are strictly positive constants. Observe that this is a short-run cost function since fixed costs (\\(c\\)) are present. The profit maximizing condition for the firm is: \\[\nC'(q) = a q + b = p \\iff q = \\frac{p - b}{a}.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nTo determine the short-run supply curve of the firm, we need to understand the nature of the fixed costs represented by \\(c.\\) In the short-run, firms are typically do not try to make positive profits, i.e., they do not need to sell each unit for at least their average total cost. Firms only need to recuperate the non-sunk part of the fixed cost. Sunk costs are fixed costs that cannot be recovered by the firm and thus should not affect its decision on future output. For example, advertising costs once spent cannot be recovered. Lease payments, on the other hand, are non-sunk fixed costs can be recovered by sublease if the firm eventually decides to shut down.\nFor simplicity, suppose that \\(c\\) is non-sunk. The average total cost in this case is equal to the average non-sunk total cost (ANSC).The firm produces so long as the market price is above the ANSC: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(q^*) &gt; 0 &\\iff p &gt; \\frac{C(q^*)}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; 0.5 a q^* + b + \\frac{c}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; 0.5 a \\frac{p - b}{a} + b + \\frac{ca}{p - b} \\\\\n&\\iff (p - b)^2 &gt; 2ca \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; b + \\sqrt{2ca}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nObserve that the last line follows from the fact that \\(q^* &gt; 0\\) if and only if \\(p &gt; b\\) in view of Equation 1. This condition tells us that in the SR, the firm suffers from a fixed cost (\\(c\\)), which might prevent it from earning positive profits even if it is operating optimally.

If there is an opportunity to make economic profits in a market, firms will enter, pushing down market prices and drive away profits. Note that making profits does not imply making economic profits. Economic profits take into account the opportunity cost of the firm. For instance, if leaving money in a bank earns an interest of 5% per month and the firm is generating less than 5% return on investment, it is not making economic profits even though it is making profits. A long-run equilibrium is reached when the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nEvery firm is maximizing profits: \\(p=MC(q)\\)\nEach firm makes zero economic profits: \\(p=AC(q)\\). This means that firms make the same profits in other competitive markets (hence no incentives for other firms to enter or for existing firms to exit)\nThe market clears: market demand equal to LR market supply at the equilibrium price\n\nHence in a LR equilibrium, firms are doing the best they can do in the market which they have no incentives to leave and no other firms have incentives to enter because of zero economic profits, and the price is such that supply is equal to demand.\n\nConsider a perfectly competitive industry populated by identical firms with the cost function \\(C(q)=10 - 5q + 2q^2\\).

    "text": "In economics, a bundle is a list or a vector of quantities of goods and services. In an \\(n\\)-good economy, each bundle \\(x\\) is an element of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). In the example below, the consumption bundle of Alex is \\(x_A = (1, 1.5)\\). If we know the prices of these goods in the economy, we can calculate the cost of his consumption as the dot product of the price vector and the consumption bundle. In addition, if we know his income, we can express his budget constraint mathematically as: \\(p\\cdot x_A \\leq I_A\\), where \\(p\\) is the price vector and \\(I_A\\) is Alex’s income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Consumption bundle with two goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning about preferences for bundles is essentially learning about how individuals compare bundles. Let us have a look at some key properties of the preference relation, namely: reflexivity, completeness, transitivity, continuity, monotonicity and (local) nonsasiation.\n\n\nBefore discussing these properties, let us fix the notations. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two consumption bundles (or alternatives) in the set \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (the set of alternatives or the choice set). Then for some individual \\(i\\):\n\n\n\nPreference\nNotation\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succeq_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succ_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) is indifferent between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\sim_i y\\)\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from context that we will eliminate the letter \\(i\\) from the notations. Note that the equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\) simply means that \\(x\\succeq y\\) and \\(y\\succeq x\\) . We also refer to the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) as the weak preference relation, as opposed to the strict preference relation \\(\\succ\\).\nTo facilitate comparison, we shall also fix the following notations:\n\n\n\nNotation\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\geq y\\)\n\\(x_j \\geq y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\dots, n\\).\n\n\n\\(x \\gt y\\)\n\\(x_j &gt; y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\cdots, n\\).\n\n\n\nFor example we typically assume that goods’ prices are strictly positive \\(p\\gt 0\\), which we sometimes write \\(p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n_{++}\\). The notation \\(x\\ge y\\) means that the quantity of each good in \\(x\\) is at least as much as that in \\(y\\), whereas \\(x\\gt y\\) means that \\(x\\) has strictly more of every good than \\(y\\). The former permits \\(x=y\\) but the latter does not.\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies reflexivity if it any alternative is weakly preferred to itself, i.e., \\(x \\succeq x\\) for any \\(x\\in X\\).\n\n\n\nA preference relation over the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is complete if for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), either \\(x \\succeq y\\), \\(y \\succeq x\\), or both (\\(x \\sim y\\)). Observe that a strict preference of \\(y\\) over \\(x\\) would be equivalent to \\(x \\succeq y\\) and \\(y \\not\\succeq x\\).\nIntuitively completeness conveys the property that one can rank any two alternatives; it is not possible to answer “I don’t know” when ask to make a comparison between two bundles.\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) be three alternatives. A preference relation is said to be transitive if:\n\\[\n    A \\succeq B \\text{ and } B \\succeq C \\implies A \\succeq C.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPreferences that are both complete and transitive are said to be rational.\nCondition Equation 1 might seem obvious at first sight, but evidence of intransitivity is rather prevalent. One of the most remarkable reasons for intransitivity is framing, the idea that ranking of preferences depends on the context. For example, one might prefer a mango to an avocado when thinking of them as fruits, but might prefer an avocado to a mango when thinking of making a salad. Other causes of intransitivity include cognitive difficulty when comparing close alternatives, or when each alternative involves multiple criteria (see textbook for details).\n\n\n\nConsider two alternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). We say that the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) satisfies monotonicity if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k &\\implies A \\succeq B, \\\\\nA \\gt B &\\implies A \\succ B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nA preference relation is said to satisfy strict monotonicity if:\n\\[\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k \\implies A \\succ B.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStrict monotonicity implies that we cannot have bads in the bundle. Monotonicity implies that we cannot have all bads in the bundle, otherwise \\(A&gt;B\\) would imply the contrary. Note that a bad, as opposed to a good, is something we dislike (for e.g., trash); we pay to acquire a good, but to get rid of a bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies nonsatiation (NS) if for every bundle, there exists a strictly preferred bundle. Let \\(X\\) be the set of all alternatives or bundles, then NS implies that for any \\(A\\in X\\) there exists \\(B\\in X\\) such that:\n\\[B \\succ A\\]\n\nRemark 1. \n\nNS allows some of the items in the bundle to be bads\nNS implies that the consumer can always find something strictly better (no best bundle)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a preference relation satisfies local nonsatiation (LNS) if for every bundle there exists in strictly preferred bundle within any \\(\\epsilon\\)-distance from it (i.e. \\(B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A\\) for all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)). Mathematically,\n\\[\n        \\forall A \\in X,\\: \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0: \\: \\exists B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A \\text{ s.t. } B \\succ A.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\nRemark 2. \n\nLNS rules out thick indifference curves\nLNS is stricter than NS; in the former a better bundle must be found in any arbitrarily close alternative whereas in the latter it could be any other bundle in the choice set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a quick summary of the relationships between monotonicity, SM, NS, LNS:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{S.Monotonicity } &\\Rightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity } \\Rightarrow \\text{ LNS} \\Rightarrow \\text{ NS} \\\\\n    \\text{NS } &\\nRightarrow \\text{LNS } \\nRightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity} \\nRightarrow \\text{ S.Monotonicity}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nContinuity (together with rationality) is needed to guarantee a utility representation of a preference relation.\n\nA preference relation defined on the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is continuous if it is preserved under limits.\n\nFor any sequence \\(\\{(x^n, y^n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) with \\(x^n \\succeq y^n\\) for all \\(n\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x^n = x\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^n = y\\), it holds \\(x \\succeq y\\).\n\nIntuitively, continuous preferences mean that there can be no sudden jumps (preference reversals) in an individual preference over a sequence of bundles\nExample of violation of continuity: lexicographic preferences (See exercise)\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility was first used in the context of economics by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) as a measure of pleasure, happiness or satisfaction derived from the consumption of goods and services.\nThe utility function was first introduced by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) in the context of probability (gambling) to account for the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nTheorem 1 (Existence) If a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) is rational (complete and transitive) and continuous on the set of alternatives \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\), then it can be represented by a continuous utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}.\\)\n\nA utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to represent a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) over \\(X\\) if for all \\(A, B \\in X\\), it holds \\(A \\succeq B \\iff u(A) \\geq u(B)\\). In other words, ranking bundles is equivalent to ranking utilities assigned to them.\nLet us now look at some common properties of a utility function. Ideally, these properties should correspond to those desired of a preference relation.\n\n\n\nUtilities are ordinal (not cardinal)\n\n\\(u(A) = 2 u(B)\\) means that \\(A\\) is strictly preferred but NOT twice as preferred as \\(B\\)\nExample: IMDb Movies ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. A movie rated 8-star is better than one rated 4-star, but this doesn’t mean that the former is twice greater (maybe slightly, maybe infinitely so, we just don’t know from looking at utilities)\n\nThis implies that any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function also represents the same preference relation as as that utility function.\n\nIn particular, if \\(u\\) represents \\(\\succeq\\) then for any strictly increasing function \\(f\\), the function \\(f \\circ u\\) also represents \\(\\succeq\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two alternatives in \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then:\n\nMonotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) (weakly) increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succeq y\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) \\geq u(y)\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\nStrictly monotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) strictly increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\n\n\nExample 1 (Perfect complements) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=\\mathrm{min}\\{ax_1, bx_2\\}\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\n\nExample 2 (Perfect substitutes) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=ax_1 + bx_2\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\nSince monotonicity implies LNS (which in turns implies NS), both of these utility functions satisfy LNS and NS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Indifference set, upper and lower contour sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have stated above that LNS implies that the ICs cannot be thick since if it were the case we would be able to find a sufficiently small neighborhood in which no alternative is strictly better than any other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: LNS rules out thick IC (in gray)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we often see that the ICs are downward sloping? It is because of strict monotonicity. Indeed, let \\(u(x, y)\\) be a utility function representing strictly monotonic preferences. For simplicity suppose that \\(u\\) is differentiable, then the partial derivatives of \\(u(\\cdot)\\) with respect to each argument, \\(u_x\\) and \\(u_y\\), are strictly positive. Along an IC, the level of utility is constant. By totally differentiating, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_x dx + u_y dy &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\\frac{u_x}{u_y}\\\\\n&&lt;0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\n\n\nConvexity of preferences captures an individual’s taste for diversification. Formally, we say that preferences are convex if the upper-contour set (UCS) is a convex set.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Convex UCS (shaded) and preferences for diversification. Observe that any mix of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is strictly preferred to \\(z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nConvexity implies diminishing marginal rates of substitution, the term on the RHS of Equation 5 (in absolute value):\n\\[\nMRS_{x, y} \\equiv \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = -\\frac{dy}{dx}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe MRS captures our willingness to exchange one good for an additional unit of another. In particular, \\(MRS_{x,y}\\) captures the amount of good \\(y\\) the individual is willing to give up for an additional unit of good \\(x\\) in order to maintain the same level of utility. The intuition behind a decreasing MRS is that as one good gets abundant, we are willing to sacrifice less of the other good for an additional unit of the abundant good. This is due to the preference for variety captured by convexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diminishing marginal rates of substitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Quasiconcavity 1) A utility function defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x \\in X\\), the upper contour set of \\(x\\), defined by \\(\\mathrm{UCS}(x) = \\{y \\in X: u(y) \\geq u(x)\\}\\), is convex.\n\nAn alternative definition of quasiconcavity is the following.\n\nDefinition 2 (Quasiconcavity 2) A utility function \\(u\\) defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x, y \\in X\\): \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) \\geq \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\] It is strictly quasiconcave if: \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) &gt; \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\]\n\nIt is easy to see that concavity implies quasiconcavity (proof as exercise). Quasiconcavity is preserved under a monotone transformation, which makes it a desirable property of utility functions. This is not true for concavity.\nThe converse is not true. For example, consider the Cobb-Douglas utility function \\(u=x^a y^b\\), where \\(a,b&gt;0\\). Suppose \\(a=b=1/4\\), then \\(u\\) is strictly concave, hence is also quasiconcave. For \\(a=b=3/2\\), the utility function is quasiconcave but not concave.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcave utility function and indifference curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuasiconcave utility function and indifference curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Homogeneous function) A function \\(u:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is homogeneous of degree \\(k\\) if for all \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), we have \\(u(\\alpha x) = \\alpha^k u(x)\\).\n\n\nVarying the amount of goods by a common factor \\(\\alpha\\) changes the utility by a factor \\(\\alpha^k\\).\n\n\\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\): an increase\n\\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\): a reduction\n\n\nFor a production function, the degree of homogeneity tells us about returns to scales of the production technology.

    "text": "Learning about preferences for bundles is essentially learning about how individuals compare bundles. Let us have a look at some key properties of the preference relation, namely: reflexivity, completeness, transitivity, continuity, monotonicity and (local) nonsasiation.\n\n\nBefore discussing these properties, let us fix the notations. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two consumption bundles (or alternatives) in the set \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (the set of alternatives or the choice set). Then for some individual \\(i\\):\n\n\n\nPreference\nNotation\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succeq_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succ_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) is indifferent between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\sim_i y\\)\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from context that we will eliminate the letter \\(i\\) from the notations. Note that the equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\) simply means that \\(x\\succeq y\\) and \\(y\\succeq x\\) . We also refer to the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) as the weak preference relation, as opposed to the strict preference relation \\(\\succ\\).\nTo facilitate comparison, we shall also fix the following notations:\n\n\n\nNotation\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\geq y\\)\n\\(x_j \\geq y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\dots, n\\).\n\n\n\\(x \\gt y\\)\n\\(x_j &gt; y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\cdots, n\\).\n\n\n\nFor example we typically assume that goods’ prices are strictly positive \\(p\\gt 0\\), which we sometimes write \\(p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n_{++}\\). The notation \\(x\\ge y\\) means that the quantity of each good in \\(x\\) is at least as much as that in \\(y\\), whereas \\(x\\gt y\\) means that \\(x\\) has strictly more of every good than \\(y\\). The former permits \\(x=y\\) but the latter does not.\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies reflexivity if it any alternative is weakly preferred to itself, i.e., \\(x \\succeq x\\) for any \\(x\\in X\\).\n\n\n\nA preference relation over the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is complete if for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), either \\(x \\succeq y\\), \\(y \\succeq x\\), or both (\\(x \\sim y\\)). Observe that a strict preference of \\(y\\) over \\(x\\) would be equivalent to \\(x \\succeq y\\) and \\(y \\not\\succeq x\\).\nIntuitively completeness conveys the property that one can rank any two alternatives; it is not possible to answer “I don’t know” when ask to make a comparison between two bundles.\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) be three alternatives. A preference relation is said to be transitive if:\n\\[\n    A \\succeq B \\text{ and } B \\succeq C \\implies A \\succeq C.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPreferences that are both complete and transitive are said to be rational.\nCondition Equation 1 might seem obvious at first sight, but evidence of intransitivity is rather prevalent. One of the most remarkable reasons for intransitivity is framing, the idea that ranking of preferences depends on the context. For example, one might prefer a mango to an avocado when thinking of them as fruits, but might prefer an avocado to a mango when thinking of making a salad. Other causes of intransitivity include cognitive difficulty when comparing close alternatives, or when each alternative involves multiple criteria (see textbook for details).\n\n\n\nConsider two alternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). We say that the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) satisfies monotonicity if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k &\\implies A \\succeq B, \\\\\nA \\gt B &\\implies A \\succ B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nA preference relation is said to satisfy strict monotonicity if:\n\\[\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k \\implies A \\succ B.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStrict monotonicity implies that we cannot have bads in the bundle. Monotonicity implies that we cannot have all bads in the bundle, otherwise \\(A&gt;B\\) would imply the contrary. Note that a bad, as opposed to a good, is something we dislike (for e.g., trash); we pay to acquire a good, but to get rid of a bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies nonsatiation (NS) if for every bundle, there exists a strictly preferred bundle. Let \\(X\\) be the set of all alternatives or bundles, then NS implies that for any \\(A\\in X\\) there exists \\(B\\in X\\) such that:\n\\[B \\succ A\\]\n\nRemark 1. \n\nNS allows some of the items in the bundle to be bads\nNS implies that the consumer can always find something strictly better (no best bundle)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a preference relation satisfies local nonsatiation (LNS) if for every bundle there exists in strictly preferred bundle within any \\(\\epsilon\\)-distance from it (i.e. \\(B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A\\) for all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)). Mathematically,\n\\[\n        \\forall A \\in X,\\: \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0: \\: \\exists B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A \\text{ s.t. } B \\succ A.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\nRemark 2. \n\nLNS rules out thick indifference curves\nLNS is stricter than NS; in the former a better bundle must be found in any arbitrarily close alternative whereas in the latter it could be any other bundle in the choice set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a quick summary of the relationships between monotonicity, SM, NS, LNS:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{S.Monotonicity } &\\Rightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity } \\Rightarrow \\text{ LNS} \\Rightarrow \\text{ NS} \\\\\n    \\text{NS } &\\nRightarrow \\text{LNS } \\nRightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity} \\nRightarrow \\text{ S.Monotonicity}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nContinuity (together with rationality) is needed to guarantee a utility representation of a preference relation.\n\nA preference relation defined on the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is continuous if it is preserved under limits.\n\nFor any sequence \\(\\{(x^n, y^n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) with \\(x^n \\succeq y^n\\) for all \\(n\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x^n = x\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^n = y\\), it holds \\(x \\succeq y\\).\n\nIntuitively, continuous preferences mean that there can be no sudden jumps (preference reversals) in an individual preference over a sequence of bundles\nExample of violation of continuity: lexicographic preferences (See exercise)",

    "text": "Utility was first used in the context of economics by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) as a measure of pleasure, happiness or satisfaction derived from the consumption of goods and services.\nThe utility function was first introduced by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) in the context of probability (gambling) to account for the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nTheorem 1 (Existence) If a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) is rational (complete and transitive) and continuous on the set of alternatives \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\), then it can be represented by a continuous utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}.\\)\n\nA utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to represent a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) over \\(X\\) if for all \\(A, B \\in X\\), it holds \\(A \\succeq B \\iff u(A) \\geq u(B)\\). In other words, ranking bundles is equivalent to ranking utilities assigned to them.\nLet us now look at some common properties of a utility function. Ideally, these properties should correspond to those desired of a preference relation.\n\n\n\nUtilities are ordinal (not cardinal)\n\n\\(u(A) = 2 u(B)\\) means that \\(A\\) is strictly preferred but NOT twice as preferred as \\(B\\)\nExample: IMDb Movies ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. A movie rated 8-star is better than one rated 4-star, but this doesn’t mean that the former is twice greater (maybe slightly, maybe infinitely so, we just don’t know from looking at utilities)\n\nThis implies that any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function also represents the same preference relation as as that utility function.\n\nIn particular, if \\(u\\) represents \\(\\succeq\\) then for any strictly increasing function \\(f\\), the function \\(f \\circ u\\) also represents \\(\\succeq\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two alternatives in \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then:\n\nMonotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) (weakly) increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succeq y\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) \\geq u(y)\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\nStrictly monotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) strictly increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\n\n\nExample 1 (Perfect complements) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=\\mathrm{min}\\{ax_1, bx_2\\}\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\n\nExample 2 (Perfect substitutes) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=ax_1 + bx_2\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\nSince monotonicity implies LNS (which in turns implies NS), both of these utility functions satisfy LNS and NS.",

In particular, \\(MRS_{x,y}\\) captures the amount of good \\(y\\) the individual is willing to give up for an additional unit of good \\(x\\) in order to maintain the same level of utility. The intuition behind a decreasing MRS is that as one good gets abundant, we are willing to sacrifice less of the other good for an additional unit of the abundant good.

Quasiconcavity is preserved under a monotone transformation, which makes it a desirable property of utility functions. This is not true for concavity.\nThe converse is not true. For example, consider the Cobb-Douglas utility function \\(u=x^a y^b\\), where \\(a,b&gt;0\\). Suppose \\(a=b=1/4\\), then \\(u\\) is strictly concave, hence is also quasiconcave.

    "text": "7.4 Types of costs:\n\n7.4.1 Explicit vs implicit costs\n\nExplicit costs: Costs that require monetary payments\nImplicit costs: Do not require monetary outlays but reflect opportunity costs\nExample: What is your cost of attending this course?\n\nExplicit cost: tuition, transportation, etc.\nImplicit cost: the salary you could have earned during the time of study\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Sunk vs nonsunk costs\n\nSunk costs: costs that cannot be recoverred even if the firm chooses to shut down its operations.\n\nExamples: Advertising expenses already spent, the rent the firm has already paid for the building if the lease does not allow subletting\n\nNonsunk costs: costs that can be sold back (recoverable or partially recoverable costs) in case the firm shuts down\n\nExample: Raw materials, the rental cost of the building if the contract allows subleases\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Long-run vs short-run costs\n\nIn the long run (LR), the firm has enough time to vary the amount of all inputs as much as necessary\nIn the short run (SR), the amount of at least one input is fixed\nExample: In short run, production factors such as land or capital are typically fixed, whereas labor is variable. In the long run, it is possible to buy more land and set up new factories, allowing all factors of production to vary.\n\nConsider a firm with Cobb-Douglas production \\(q = L^a K^b\\) where \\(K=\\bar{K}&gt;0\\) is fixed in the SR. Thus the cost function found above is the LR cost. The SR cost can be found by solving the CMP with respect to \\(L\\) only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Short-run vs long-run cost function\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.4 Average and marginal costs\n\n\nAverage cost (AC): total cost of production per output unit:\n\\[\n  AC(q) = \\frac{C(q)}{q},\n   \\tag{14}\\] where \\(C(q)\\) is the total cost.\nMarginal cost (MC): the rate at which the total cost increases as the firm produces an additional unit of output. Graphically it is the slope of the total cost curve:\n\\[\n  MC(q) = C'(q)\n   \\tag{15}\\] in the continuous case.2\nThe MC curve crosses the AC curve at the AC’s minimum. In other words, the AC is decreasing when it is above the MC and increasing when it is above the MC.\nIntuition:\n\nInitially when output is small, the variable cost is small and the fixed cost dominates the total cost\nAs output increases, the importance of fixed cost declines. Meanwhile, the MC increases (due to decreasing marginal product)\nAfter a threshold, producing an additional unit costs more than the AC of existing units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Short-run average and marginal costs",

In other words, the firm is not a price-taker in the labor market: it has influences over the wage by deciding on the number of workers to hire.\nThe monopsonist’s PMP: \\[\n\\max_{L\\geq 0} \\pi =pq - w(L)L = pf(L) - w(L)L.\n\\]\nDifferentiating w.r.t \\(L\\) yields: \\[\n\\pi'(L) = 0 \\iff pf'(L) = w(L) + w'(L)L.\n\\tag{11}\\]\nObserve that the LHS of Equation 11 represents the marginal revenue brought about but an additional worker (\\(f'\\) is the marginal output). It is often referred to as the marginal revenue product of labor (\\(MRP\\)).\nThe RHS of Equation 11 captures the marginal cost or the marginal expenditure on labor (\\(ME\\)). As the labor market becomes scarce, employing an additional worker raises the wage to \\(w(L)\\). The increased wage \\(w'&gt;0\\) must be enjoyed by all the workers, which is captured by the second term. An analogy with the monopoly might help us remember these terms. In particular:\n\n\\(w(L)\\) to \\(p(q)\\): Supply to demand\n\\(ME(L)\\) to \\(MR(q)\\): Marginal expenditure to marginal revenue\n\\(MRP(L)\\) to \\(MC(q)\\). Marginal revenue product to marginal cost\n\nLet us look at a numerical example.\n\nExample 7 Consider a coal mine in a small town with production function \\(q = 30\\ln L\\). The market for coal is a perfectly competitive one with price \\(p=\\$5\\) per unit. The labor market where the mine operates has supply given by \\(w(L) = 5 + \\frac{1}{2}L.\\) Determine the number of workers hired and the equilibrium wage in this market.\nThe monopsony’s PMP: \\[\n\\pi(L) = 150\\ln(L) - (5 + \\frac{1}{2}L)L,\n\\]\nwhich is strictly concave in \\(L.\\) The necessary and sufficient condition for a max is: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi'(L) = 0 \\iff \\frac{150}{L} &= 5 + L \\\\\nL^2 + 5L - 150 &= 0 \\\\\nL &= 10.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHence the optimal number of hires is 26 for a wage rate of \\(w(10) = \\$10.\\)\nIf the market were competitive, the firm would have taken the wage as given while soving its PMP. The condition for a max in this case would have been:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\npq'(L) &= w(L) \\\\\n\\frac{150}{L} &= 5 + \\frac{1}{2}L \\\\\nL &= -5 + \\sqrt{325} \\approx 13.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe competitive wage would have been \\(w(13)=11.5.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Consequences of monopsony\n\n\n\nTo conclude, we see that compared to a competitive buyer, the monopsonist buys a lower quantity at a lower price and this creates a dead weight loss in the market, as in the case of the monopoly.",

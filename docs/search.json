    "text": "In economics, a bundle is a list or a vector of quantities of goods and services. In an \\(n\\)-good economy, each bundle \\(x\\) is an element of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). In the example below, the consumption bundle of Alex is \\(x_A = (1, 1.5)\\). If we know the prices of these goods in the economy, we can calculate the cost of his consumption as the dot product of the price vector and the consumption bundle. In addition, if we know his income, we can express his budget constraint mathematically as: \\(p\\cdot x_A \\leq I_A\\), where \\(p\\) is the price vector and \\(I_A\\) is Alex’s income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Consumption bundle with two goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning about preferences for bundles is essentially learning about how individuals compare bundles. Let us have a look at some key properties of the preference relation, namely: reflexivity, completeness, transitivity, continuity, monotonicity and (local) nonsasiation.\n\n\nBefore discussing these properties, let us fix the notations. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two consumption bundles (or alternatives) in the set \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (the set of alternatives or the choice set). Then for some individual \\(i\\):\n\nPreference relation\n\n\nPreference\nNotation\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succeq_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succ_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) is indifferent between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\sim_i y\\)\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from context that we will eliminate the letter \\(i\\) from the notations. Note that the equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\) simply means that \\(x\\succeq y\\) and \\(y\\succeq x\\) . We also refer to the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) as the weak preference relation, as opposed to the strict preference relation \\(\\succ\\).\nTo facilitate comparison, we shall also fix the following notations:\n\n\n\nNotation\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\geq y\\)\n\\(x_j \\geq y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\dots, n\\).\n\n\n\\(x \\gt y\\)\n\\(x_j &gt; y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\cdots, n\\).\n\n\n\nFor example we typically assume that goods’ prices are strictly positive \\(p\\gg 0\\), which we sometimes write \\(p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n_{++}\\). The notation \\(x\\ge y\\) means that the quantity of each good in \\(x\\) is at least as much as that in \\(y\\), whereas \\(x\\gt y\\) means that \\(x\\) has strictly more of every good than \\(y\\). The former permits \\(x=y\\) but the latter does not.\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies reflexivity if it any alternative is weakly preferred to itself, i.e., \\(x \\succeq x\\) for any \\(x\\in X\\).\n\n\n\nA preference relation over the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is complete if for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), either \\(x \\succeq y\\), \\(y \\succeq x\\), or both (\\(x \\sim y\\)). Observe that a strict preference of \\(y\\) over \\(x\\) would be equivalent to \\(x \\succeq y\\) and \\(y \\not\\succeq x\\).\nIntuitively completeness conveys the property that one can rank any two alternatives; it is not possible to answer “I don’t know” when ask to make a comparison between two bundles.\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) be three alternatives. A preference relation is said to be transitive if:\n\\[\n    A \\succeq B \\text{ and } B \\succeq C \\implies A \\succeq C.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPreferences that are both complete and transitive are said to be rational.\nCondition Equation 1 might seem obvious at first sight, but evidence of intransitivity is rather prevalent. One of the most remarkable reasons for intransitivity is framing, the idea that ranking of preferences depends on the context. For example, one might prefer a mango to an avocado when thinking of them as fruits, but might prefer an avocado to a mango when thinking of making a salad. Other causes of intransitivity include cognitive difficulty when comparing close alternatives, or when each alternative involves multiple criteria (see textbook for details).\n\n\n\nConsider two alternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). We say that the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) satisfies monotonicity if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k &\\implies A \\succeq B, \\\\\nA \\gt B &\\implies A \\succ B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nA preference relation is said to satisfy strict monotonicity if:\n\\[\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k \\implies A \\succ B.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStrict monotonicity implies that we cannot have bads in the bundle. Monotonicity implies that we cannot have all bads in the bundle, otherwise \\(A&gt;B\\) would imply the contrary. Note that a bad, as opposed to a good, is something we dislike (for e.g., trash); we pay to acquire a good, but to get rid of a bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies nonsatiation (NS) if for every bundle, there exists a strictly preferred bundle. Let \\(X\\) be the set of all alternatives or bundles, then NS implies that for any \\(A\\in X\\) there exists \\(B\\in X\\) such that:\n\\[B \\succ A\\]\n\nRemark 1. \n\nNS allows some of the items in the bundle to be bads\nNS implies that the consumer can always find something strictly better (no best bundle)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a preference relation satisfies local nonsatiation (LNS) if for every bundle there exists in strictly preferred bundle within any \\(\\epsilon\\)-distance from it (i.e. \\(B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A\\) for all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)). Mathematically,\n\\[\n        \\forall A \\in X,\\: \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0: \\: \\exists B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A \\text{ s.t. } B \\succ A.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\nRemark 2. \n\nLNS rules out thick indifference curves\nLNS is stricter than NS; in the former a better bundle must be found in any arbitrarily close alternative whereas in the latter it could be any other bundle in the choice set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a quick summary of the relationships between monotonicity, SM, NS, LNS:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{S.Monotonicity } &\\Rightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity } \\Rightarrow \\text{ LNS} \\Rightarrow \\text{ NS} \\\\\n    \\text{NS } &\\nRightarrow \\text{LNS } \\nRightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity} \\nRightarrow \\text{ S.Monotonicity}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nContinuity (together with rationality) is needed to guarantee a utility representation of a preference relation.\n\nA preference relation defined on the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is continuous if it is preserved under limits.\n\nFor any sequence \\(\\{(x^n, y^n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) with \\(x^n \\succeq y^n\\) for all \\(n\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x^n = x\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^n = y\\), it holds \\(x \\succeq y\\).\n\nIntuitively, continuous preferences mean that there can be no sudden jumps (preference reversals) in an individual preference over a sequence of bundles\nExample of violation of continuity: lexicographic preferences (See exercise)\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility was first used in the context of economics by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) as a measure of pleasure, happiness or satisfaction derived from the consumption of goods and services.\nThe utility function was first introduced by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) in the context of probability (gambling) to account for the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nTheorem 1 (Existence) If a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) is rational (complete and transitive) and continuous on the set of alternatives \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\), then it can be represented by a continuous utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}.\\)\n\nA utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to represent a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) over \\(X\\) if for all \\(A, B \\in X\\), it holds \\(A \\succeq B \\iff u(A) \\geq u(B)\\). In other words, ranking bundles is equivalent to ranking utilities assigned to them.\nLet us now look at some common properties of a utility function. Ideally, these properties should correspond to those desired of a preference relation.\n\n\n\nUtilities are ordinal (not cardinal)\n\n\\(u(A) = 2 u(B)\\) means that \\(A\\) is strictly preferred but NOT twice as preferred as \\(B\\)\nExample: IMDb Movies ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. A movie rated 8-star is better than one rated 4-star, but this doesn’t mean that the former is twice greater (maybe slightly, maybe infinitely so, we just don’t know from looking at utilities)\n\nThis implies that any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function also represents the same preference relation as as that utility function.\n\nIn particular, if \\(u\\) represents \\(\\succeq\\) then for any strictly increasing function \\(f\\), the function \\(f \\circ u\\) also represents \\(\\succeq\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two alternatives in \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then:\n\nMonotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) (weakly) increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succeq y\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) \\geq u(y)\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\nStrictly monotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) strictly increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\n\n\nExample 1 (Perfect complements) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=\\mathrm{min}\\{ax_1, bx_2\\}\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\n\nExample 2 (Perfect substitutes) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=ax_1 + bx_2\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\nSince monotonicity implies LNS (which in turns implies NS), both of these utility functions satisfy LNS and NS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Indifference set, upper and lower contour sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have stated above that LNS implies that the ICs cannot be thick since if it were the case we would be able to find a sufficiently small neighborhood in which no alternative is strictly better than any other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: LNS rules out thick IC (in gray)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we often see that the ICs are downward sloping? It is because of strict monotonicity. Indeed, let \\(u(x, y)\\) be a utility function representing strictly monotonic preferences. For simplicity suppose that \\(u\\) is differentiable, then the partial derivatives of \\(u(\\cdot)\\) with respect to each argument, \\(u_x\\) and \\(u_y\\), are strictly positive. Along an IC, the level of utility is constant. By totally differentiating, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_x dx + u_y dy &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\\frac{u_x}{u_y}\\\\\n&&lt;0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\n\n\nConvexity of preferences captures an individual’s taste for diversification. Formally, we say that preferences are convex if the upper-contour set (UCS) is a convex set.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Convex UCS (shaded) and preferences for diversification. Observe that any mix of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is strictly preferred to \\(z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nConvexity implies diminishing marginal rates of substitution, the term on the RHS of Equation 5 (in absolute value):\n\\[\nMRS_{x, y} \\equiv \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = -\\frac{dy}{dx}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe MRS captures our willingness to exchange one good for an additional unit of another. In particular, \\(MRS_{x,y}\\) captures the amount of good \\(y\\) the individual is willing to give up for an additional unit of good \\(x\\) in order to maintain the same level of utility. The intuition behind a decreasing MRS is that as one good gets abundant, we are willing to sacrifice less of the other good for an additional unit of the abundant good. This is due to the preference for variety captured by convexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diminishing marginal rates of substitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Quasiconcavity 1) A utility function defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x \\in X\\), the upper contour set of \\(x\\), defined by \\(\\mathrm{UCS}(x) = \\{y \\in X: u(y) \\geq u(x)\\}\\), is convex.\n\nAn alternative definition of quasiconcavity is the following.\n\nDefinition 2 (Quasiconcavity 2) A utility function \\(u\\) defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x, y \\in X\\): \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) \\geq \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\] It is strictly quasiconcave if: \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) &gt; \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\]\n\nIt is easy to see that concavity implies quasiconcavity (proof as exercise). Quasiconcavity is preserved under a monotone transformation, which makes it a desirable property of utility functions. This is not true for concavity.\nThe converse is not true. For example, consider the Cobb-Douglas utility function \\(u=x^a y^b\\), where \\(a,b&gt;0\\). Suppose \\(a=b=1/4\\), then \\(u\\) is strictly concave, hence is also quasiconcave. For \\(a=b=3/2\\), the utility function is quasiconcave but not concave.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcave utility function and indifference curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuasiconcave utility function and indifference curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Homogeneous function) A function \\(u:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is homogeneous of degree \\(k\\) if for all \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\), we have \\(u(\\alpha x) = \\alpha^k u(x)\\).\n\n\nVarying the amount of goods by a common factor \\(\\alpha\\) changes the utility by a factor \\(\\alpha^k\\).\n\n\\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\): an increase\n\\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\): a reduction\n\n\nFor a production function, the degree of homogeneity tells us about returns to scales of the production technology. In particular:\n\n\\(k&lt;1\\): DRS\n\\(k=1\\): CRS\n\\(k&gt;1\\): IRS\n\n\n\nDefinition 4 (Homogeneous preference) A preference relation is homogeneous if it can be represented by a homogeneous utility function\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(u\\) is homogeneous of degree \\(k\\), then its first-order partial derivatives are homogeneous of degree \\(k-1\\): \\[\nu(\\alpha x) = \\alpha^k u(x) \\implies u_j(\\alpha x) = \\alpha^{k-1} u_j(x).\n  \\tag{7}\\]\nThe ICs of homogeneous functions are radial expansions of one another, i.e., if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) lie on the same IC, then so are \\(\\alpha y\\) and \\(\\alpha x\\): \\[\nu(x) = u(y) \\implies u(\\alpha x) = u(\\alpha y).\n  \\tag{8}\\]\n\nKnowing the shape of a single IC tells us the shape of all other ICs\n\nThe MRS of a homogeneous function is constant for all points along each ray from the origin (homogeneity of degree \\(0\\)): \\[MRS_{1,2}(x) = MRS_{1,2}(\\alpha x), \\quad \\forall x\\in X.\\]\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\nProof. \n\nPartially differentiating w.r.t \\(x_i\\) yields: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial u(\\alpha x)}{\\partial (\\alpha x_j)}\\alpha &= \\alpha^k \\frac{\\partial u(x)}{\\partial x_j} \\\\\nu_j(\\alpha x) &= \\alpha^{k-1} u_j(x).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis comes from the definition: \\[\nu(x) = u(y) \\iff \\alpha^k u(x) = \\alpha^k u(y) \\iff u(\\alpha x) = u(\\alpha y).\n\\]\nThis can be proven by using the first property: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nMRS_{1,2}(x) \\equiv \\frac{U_1(x)}{U_2(x)}\n&= \\frac{\\alpha^{k-1}U_1(x)}{\\alpha^{k-1}U_2(x)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{U_1(\\alpha x)}{U_2(\\alpha x)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 5 (Homothetic function) A function \\(u:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is homothetic if it is obtained by a monotonic transformation of a homogeneous function (Definition 3), i.e., if there exist a strictly increasing function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) and a homogeneous function \\(v:X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) such that: \\[\nu(x) = f(v(x)).\n\\tag{9}\\]\n\nClearly, a homogeneneous function is also homothetic (let \\(f\\) be the identity function). Importantly, homotheticity is preserved under a monotone transformation whereas homogeneity is not. It is thus a desirable property of utility functions. As in the case of homogeneity, we can also talk about homothetic preferences.\n\nDefinition 6 (Homothetic preference) A preference relation is homothetic if it can be represented by a homothetic utility function (Definition 5).\n\nSince a homogeneous utility function is homothetic, homogeneous preferences are also homothetic, but the converse is not true.\n\n\n\nICs are radial expansion of the origin: \\(x \\sim y \\implies \\alpha x \\sim \\alpha y\\) for all scalar \\(\\alpha &gt;  0\\)\nMRS is homogeneous of degree \\(0\\): The rate at which the individual substitutes one good for another depends only on the proportion of the two goods consumed, and not on:\n\nthe utility level obtained\nthe absolute quantities of the goods\n\nHomotheticity is preserved under a monotonic transformation, while homogeneity is not\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\nSuppose \\(u\\) is homothetic. We want to show \\(u=f(v(x))\\) for some homothetic \\(v\\) and strictly increasing function \\(f\\). Since \\(v\\) is homothetic there exists a strictly increasing function \\(h\\) and a homogeneous function \\(t\\) such that \\(v=h(t(x))\\). Hence \\(u=f(h(t(x))) = (f\\circ h) (t(x))\\) where \\(f\\circ h\\) is strictly increasing. This shows that \\(u\\) is a monotonic transformation of \\(t\\), a homog function, hence is homothetic\nThat homogeneity is not preseved under a monotonic transformation can be shown by a counter example. For instance, consider \\(u(x, y) = xy\\), which is homogeneous of degree 2 (why?), but the monotone transformation \\(f(u) = u + a\\) for some constant \\(a&gt;0\\) is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function: \\[\n  u(x, y) = [\\alpha x^p + (1 - \\alpha)y^p]^{1/p},\n\\tag{10}\\] where \\(p\\neq 0\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\).\nThe CES function is a generalization of several other functions.\n\nWhen \\(p\\) approaches 0, it becomes the Cobb-Douglas utility function\nWhen \\(p\\) approachs \\(-\\infty\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y) = \\min \\{ax, by\\}\\), the Leontief utility function\nWhen \\(p=1\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y)= ax + by\\), which represents preferences for perfect substitutes\n\nConstant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility: \\[\nu(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}, & \\sigma&gt;0,\\: \\sigma\\neq 1 \\\\\n\\ln (x), & \\sigma = 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The CRRA utility function is used extensively in models of decision making under uncertainty.",

We say that the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) satisfies monotonicity if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k &\\implies A \\succeq B, \\\\\nA \\gt B &\\implies A \\succ B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nA preference relation is said to satisfy strict monotonicity if:\n\\[\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k \\implies A \\succ B.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStrict monotonicity implies that we cannot have bads in the bundle. Monotonicity implies that we cannot have all bads in the bundle, otherwise \\(A&gt;B\\) would imply the contrary. Note that a bad, as opposed to a good, is something we dislike (for e.g., trash); we pay to acquire a good, but to get rid of a bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies nonsatiation (NS) if for every bundle, there exists a strictly preferred bundle. Let \\(X\\) be the set of all alternatives or bundles, then NS implies that for any \\(A\\in X\\) there exists \\(B\\in X\\) such that:\n\\[B \\succ A\\]\n\nRemark 1. \n\nNS allows some of the items in the bundle to be bads\nNS implies that the consumer can always find something strictly better (no best bundle)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a preference relation satisfies local nonsatiation (LNS) if for every bundle there exists in strictly preferred bundle within any \\(\\epsilon\\)-distance from it (i.e. \\(B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A\\) for all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)). Mathematically,\n\\[\n        \\forall A \\in X,\\: \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0: \\: \\exists B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A \\text{ s.t. } B \\succ A.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\nRemark 2. \n\nLNS rules out thick indifference curves\nLNS is stricter than NS; in the former a better bundle must be found in any arbitrarily close alternative whereas in the latter it could be any other bundle in the choice set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a quick summary of the relationships between monotonicity, SM, NS, LNS:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{S.Monotonicity } &\\Rightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity } \\Rightarrow \\text{ LNS} \\Rightarrow \\text{ NS} \\\\\n    \\text{NS } &\\nRightarrow \\text{LNS } \\nRightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity} \\nRightarrow \\text{ S.Monotonicity}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nContinuity (together with rationality) is needed to guarantee a utility representation of a preference relation.\n\nA preference relation defined on the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is continuous if it is preserved under limits.\n\nFor any sequence \\(\\{(x^n, y^n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) with \\(x^n \\succeq y^n\\) for all \\(n\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x^n = x\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^n = y\\), it holds \\(x \\succeq y\\).\n\nIntuitively, continuous preferences mean that there can be no sudden jumps (preference reversals) in an individual preference over a sequence of bundles\nExample of violation of continuity: lexicographic preferences (See exercise)",

    "text": "Utility was first used in the context of economics by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) as a measure of pleasure, happiness or satisfaction derived from the consumption of goods and services.\nThe utility function was first introduced by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) in the context of probability (gambling) to account for the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nTheorem 1 (Existence) If a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) is rational (complete and transitive) and continuous on the set of alternatives \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\), then it can be represented by a continuous utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}.\\)\n\nA utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to represent a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) over \\(X\\) if for all \\(A, B \\in X\\), it holds \\(A \\succeq B \\iff u(A) \\geq u(B)\\). In other words, ranking bundles is equivalent to ranking utilities assigned to them.\nLet us now look at some common properties of a utility function. Ideally, these properties should correspond to those desired of a preference relation.\n\n\n\nUtilities are ordinal (not cardinal)\n\n\\(u(A) = 2 u(B)\\) means that \\(A\\) is strictly preferred but NOT twice as preferred as \\(B\\)\nExample: IMDb Movies ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. A movie rated 8-star is better than one rated 4-star, but this doesn’t mean that the former is twice greater (maybe slightly, maybe infinitely so, we just don’t know from looking at utilities)\n\nThis implies that any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function also represents the same preference relation as as that utility function.\n\nIn particular, if \\(u\\) represents \\(\\succeq\\) then for any strictly increasing function \\(f\\), the function \\(f \\circ u\\) also represents \\(\\succeq\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two alternatives in \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then:\n\nMonotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) (weakly) increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succeq y\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) \\geq u(y)\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\nStrictly monotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) strictly increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\n\n\nExample 1 (Perfect complements) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=\\mathrm{min}\\{ax_1, bx_2\\}\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\n\nExample 2 (Perfect substitutes) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=ax_1 + bx_2\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\nSince monotonicity implies LNS (which in turns implies NS), both of these utility functions satisfy LNS and NS.",

    "text": "Figure 2: Indifference set, upper and lower contour sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have stated above that LNS implies that the ICs cannot be thick since if it were the case we would be able to find a sufficiently small neighborhood in which no alternative is strictly better than any other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: LNS rules out thick IC (in gray)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we often see that the ICs are downward sloping? It is because of strict monotonicity. Indeed, let \\(u(x, y)\\) be a utility function representing strictly monotonic preferences. For simplicity suppose that \\(u\\) is differentiable, then the partial derivatives of \\(u(\\cdot)\\) with respect to each argument, \\(u_x\\) and \\(u_y\\), are strictly positive. Along an IC, the level of utility is constant.

Formally, we say that preferences are convex if the upper-contour set (UCS) is a convex set.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Convex UCS (shaded) and preferences for diversification. Observe that any mix of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is strictly preferred to \\(z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nConvexity implies diminishing marginal rates of substitution, the term on the RHS of Equation 5 (in absolute value):\n\\[\nMRS_{x, y} \\equiv \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = -\\frac{dy}{dx}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe MRS captures our willingness to exchange one good for an additional unit of another. In particular, \\(MRS_{x,y}\\) captures the amount of good \\(y\\) the individual is willing to give up for an additional unit of good \\(x\\) in order to maintain the same level of utility. The intuition behind a decreasing MRS is that as one good gets abundant, we are willing to sacrifice less of the other good for an additional unit of the abundant good. This is due to the preference for variety captured by convexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diminishing marginal rates of substitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Quasiconcavity 1) A utility function defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x \\in X\\), the upper contour set of \\(x\\), defined by \\(\\mathrm{UCS}(x) = \\{y \\in X: u(y) \\geq u(x)\\}\\), is convex.\n\nAn alternative definition of quasiconcavity is the following.\n\nDefinition 2 (Quasiconcavity 2) A utility function \\(u\\) defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x, y \\in X\\): \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) \\geq \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\] It is strictly quasiconcave if: \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) &gt; \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\]\n\nIt is easy to see that concavity implies quasiconcavity (proof as exercise). Quasiconcavity is preserved under a monotone transformation, which makes it a desirable property of utility functions. This is not true for concavity.\nThe converse is not true. For example, consider the Cobb-Douglas utility function \\(u=x^a y^b\\), where \\(a,b&gt;0\\). Suppose \\(a=b=1/4\\), then \\(u\\) is strictly concave, hence is also quasiconcave. For \\(a=b=3/2\\), the utility function is quasiconcave but not concave.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcave utility function and indifference curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuasiconcave utility function and indifference curves",

Importantly, homotheticity is preserved under a monotone transformation whereas homogeneity is not. It is thus a desirable property of utility functions. As in the case of homogeneity, we can also talk about homothetic preferences.\n\nDefinition 6 (Homothetic preference) A preference relation is homothetic if it can be represented by a homothetic utility function (Definition 5).\n\nSince a homogeneous utility function is homothetic, homogeneous preferences are also homothetic, but the converse is not true.\n\n\n\nICs are radial expansion of the origin: \\(x \\sim y \\implies \\alpha x \\sim \\alpha y\\) for all scalar \\(\\alpha &gt;  0\\)\nMRS is homogeneous of degree \\(0\\): The rate at which the individual substitutes one good for another depends only on the proportion of the two goods consumed, and not on:\n\nthe utility level obtained\nthe absolute quantities of the goods\n\nHomotheticity is preserved under a monotonic transformation, while homogeneity is not\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\nSuppose \\(u\\) is homothetic. We want to show \\(u=f(v(x))\\) for some homothetic \\(v\\) and strictly increasing function \\(f\\). Since \\(v\\) is homothetic there exists a strictly increasing function \\(h\\) and a homogeneous function \\(t\\) such that \\(v=h(t(x))\\). Hence \\(u=f(h(t(x))) = (f\\circ h) (t(x))\\) where \\(f\\circ h\\) is strictly increasing. This shows that \\(u\\) is a monotonic transformation of \\(t\\), a homog function, hence is homothetic\nThat homogeneity is not preseved under a monotonic transformation can be shown by a counter example. For instance, consider \\(u(x, y) = xy\\), which is homogeneous of degree 2 (why?), but the monotone transformation \\(f(u) = u + a\\) for some constant \\(a&gt;0\\) is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function: \\[\n  u(x, y) = [\\alpha x^p + (1 - \\alpha)y^p]^{1/p},\n\\tag{10}\\] where \\(p\\neq 0\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\).\nThe CES function is a generalization of several other functions.\n\nWhen \\(p\\) approaches 0, it becomes the Cobb-Douglas utility function\nWhen \\(p\\) approachs \\(-\\infty\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y) = \\min \\{ax, by\\}\\), the Leontief utility function\nWhen \\(p=1\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y)= ax + by\\), which represents preferences for perfect substitutes\n\nConstant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility: \\[\nu(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}, & \\sigma&gt;0,\\: \\sigma\\neq 1 \\\\\n\\ln (x), & \\sigma = 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The CRRA utility function is used extensively in models of decision making under uncertainty.",

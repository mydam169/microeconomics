    "text": "In this chapter we will be examining market equilibria. We shall begin by deriving the market supply curve, which results from firms’ optimal production decision. Likewise, market demand results from consumers’ optimal consumption decision. Searching for an equilibrium is essentially searching for prices that equalize demand and supply in the market. When a single market is considered in isolation, its equilibrium is a partial one. When all markets are considered, we speak of a general equilibrium. In a pure exchange economy, all markets are markets of consumption goods. In a production economy, the relevant markets include those of factors of production such as labor, capital and land. In this course, we will be mostly interested in general equilibria in a pure exchange economy.",

    "text": "2.4 Examples\n\nExample 1 Let us solve the PMP of a price-taking firm in the output market (and inputs market). Assume that it has a Cobb-Douglas production function defined by \\(q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2}\\). The factor prices are \\(w=\\$40\\) and \\(r=\\$10\\) as before.\n\nStep 1: Solve the CMP:\n\\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  &\\min_{K,L} 40L + 10K \\\\\n  \\text{s.t. } &q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2} \\geq q,\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\nfor some target output level \\(q\\).\n\nThe cost function can be obtained by replacing the solutions of the CMP into the objective function. This yields:\n\n\\[\n  C(q) = 40q.\n  \\]\nStep 2: Substitute \\(C(q)\\) obtained from the CMP into the PMP so that this problem reads:\n\\[\n  \\max_{q\\geq0} \\pi(q) = pq - 40q = (p - 40)q.\n  \\]\n\nClearly if \\(p&lt;40\\) the firm should shut down\nIf \\(p\\geq 40\\), the firm produces as much as possible since the profit is then incresing in output\nWe thus obtain a perfectly elastic individual supply curve\nNote that this is the long-run individual supply curve since all inputs are variable. One can also verify that the long-run cost function does not have a fixed cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A perfectly elastic long-run supply curve\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2 Suppose we have obtained a convex cost function for the firm of the form: \\[\nC(q) = 0.5 a q^2 + bq + c,\n\\] where \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are strictly positive constants. Observe that this is a short-run cost function since fixed costs (\\(c\\)) are present. The profit maximizing condition for the firm is: \\[\nC'(q) = a q + b = p \\iff q = \\frac{p - b}{a}.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nTo determine the short-run supply curve of the firm, we need to understand the nature of the fixed costs represented by \\(c.\\) In the short-run, firms are typically do not try to make positive profits, i.e., they do not need to sell each unit for at least their average total cost. Firms only need to recuperate the non-sunk part of the fixed cost. Sunk costs are fixed costs that cannot be recovered by the firm and thus should not affect its decision on future output. For example, advertising costs once spent cannot be recovered. Lease payments, on the other hand, are non-sunk fixed costs can be recovered by sublease if the firm eventually decides to shut down.\nFor simplicity, suppose that \\(c\\) is non-sunk. The average total cost in this case is equal to the average non-sunk total cost (ANSC).The firm produces so long as the market price is above the ANSC: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(q^*) &gt; 0 &\\iff p &gt; \\frac{C(q^*)}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; 0.5 a q^* + b + \\frac{c}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; 0.5 a \\frac{p - b}{a} + b + \\frac{ca}{p - b} \\\\\n&\\iff (p - b)^2 &gt; 2ca \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; b + \\sqrt{2ca}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nObserve that the last line follows from the fact that \\(q^* &gt; 0\\) if and only if \\(p &gt; b\\) in view of Equation 1. This condition tells us that in the SR, the firm suffers from a fixed cost (\\(c\\)), which might prevent it from earning positive profits even if it is operating optimally. Note that \\(p &gt; b + \\sqrt{2ca}\\) is equivalent to \\(q &gt; \\sqrt{2c/a}.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Profit as a function of market price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A SR upward sloping supply curve \\(q = \\frac{p - b}{a}\\) for \\(p &gt; b + \\sqrt{2ac}\\)",

    "text": "3.1 Short-run equilibrium\nIn the short run, the market supply curve is an horizontal aggregation of individual supplies. In other words, to construct the SR market supply curve, one adds up the quantities supplied by all the firms in the market at each given price. The market demand curve is constructed in the same manner. By equating supply and demand, we can determine the market equilibrium.\n\nExample 3 Suppose the market demand is given by \\(q^D(p) = 100 - 2p.\\) Consider a market with \\(N\\) identical firms, each facing the same cost function \\(C(q)=10−5q+2q^2.\\) In view of Exercise 1, the SR market supply is given by: \\[\nq^S(p) =\n\\begin{cases} N(p/4 + 5/4) & p &gt; 4\\sqrt{2.5}-5\\approx 1.32 \\\\\n                     0 & \\mathrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIn equilibrium \\(q^S(p) = q^D(p)\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n100 - 2p &= N(p/4 + 5/4) \\\\\np &= \\frac{5(80 - N)}{8 + N}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Hence the market price is a decreasing function of the number of firms.

    "text": "3.2 Long-run equilibrium\nIn a competitive market, firms can freely enter or exit. If there is an opportunity to make economic profits in a market, firms will enter, pushing down market prices and drive away profits. Note that making profits does not imply making economic profits. Economic profits take into account the opportunity cost of the firm. For instance, if leaving money in a bank earns an interest of 5% per month and the firm is generating less than 5% return on investment, it is not making economic profits even though it is making profits. A long-run equilibrium is reached when the following conditions are satisfied:\n\nEvery firm is maximizing profits: \\(p=MC(q)\\)\nEach firm makes zero economic profits: \\(p=AC(q)\\)\n\nThis means that firms make the same profits in other competitive markets (hence no incentives for other firms to enter or for existing firms to exit)\n\nMarket demand equal to LR market supply\n\n\\(q^S(p) = q^D(p)\\)\n\n\nHence in a LR equilibrium, firms are doing the best they can do in the market which they have no incentives to leave and no other firms have incentives to enter because of zero economic profits, and the price is such that supply is equal to demand.\n\nConsider a perfectly competitive industry populated by identical firms with the cost function \\(C(q)=10 - 5q + 2q^2\\). We would like to determine the long-run equilibrium of the market as well as the equilibrium number of firms operating in it.1\nDenote the LR equilibrium quantity, price and market size \\(q^*\\), \\(p^*\\) and \\(N^*\\), respectively.\n\nSince each firm in the market sets \\(MC(q_i^*) = AC(q_i^*)\\): \\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  -5 + 4 q^*_i &= \\frac{10}{q_i^*} - 5 + 2 q_i^* \\\\\n  q_i^* &= \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24.\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\nSince \\(MC(q_i^*) = p^*\\), we can deduce the LR equilibrium market price: \\[\n  p^* = -5 + 4 q^*_i = -5 + 4 \\sqrt{5} \\approx 3.94\n  \\]\nEquilibirum quantity can be found using the market demand equation: \\[\n  q^* = 100 - 2p^* \\approx 92.11\n  \\]\nThe number of active firms in the LR: \\[\n  N^* = \\frac{q^*}{q_i^*} \\approx 41.19\n  \\]\nHence in the LR equilibrium, the price will be about \\(\\$3.94\\) per unit.

    "section": "6.1 Adding production to the economy",
    "text": "6.1 Adding production to the economy\nIn a production economy, consumers own factors of production, which they can rent out to firms to earn income. Firms choose the quantity of factors of production to maximize profit, taking as given the prices (of factors and final consumption goods). Consumers choose the quantity of consumption goods to maximize utility, taking as given prices (of factors and final consumption goods). In equilibrium, aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply in each market, including markets of production factors.\n\nExample 5 Consider an economy two consumers with Cobb-Douglas utility function \\[\nu(x_1^i, x_2^i) = x_1^i x_2^i\n\\] for each consumer \\(i=A, B\\) whose endowments are: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ne^A &= (k^A, l^A), \\\\\ne^B &= (k^B, l^B).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nSuppose there are two firms in the economy, each producing one of the consumption goods according to a Cobb-Douglas technology: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 = F^1(K_1, L_1) &= K_1^a L_1^b, \\\\\ny_2 = F^2(K_2, L_2) &= K_2^b L_2^a,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(a+b=1\\) and \\(a, b \\in (0,1)\\).\nAn allocation \\((x_1^A, x_1^B, x_2^A, x_2^B, K_1, L_1, K_2, L_2)\\) and a price vector \\(p=(p_1, p_2, w, r)\\) constitute a competive equilibrium (or Walrasian equilibrium) of the production economy if:\n\nGiven prices, \\((x_1^i, x_2^i)\\) solves the UMP for each consumer \\(i\\in\\{A,B\\}.\\)\nGiven prices, \\((K_j, L_j)\\) solves the PMP for each firm \\(j\\in \\{1,2\\}.\\)\nPrices are such that markets clear: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Consumption goods:   }\\sum_i x^i_j &= y_j \\equiv F^j(K_j, L_j), \\quad \\forall j=1,2, \\\\\n\\text{Capital good:   }\\sum_j K_j &= k^A + k^B, \\\\\n\\text{Labor good:   }\\sum_j L_j &= l^A + l^B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] In other words, we are in an equilibrium if ever agent optimizes and markets clear. Let us first consider the consumers, who face the UMP.\n\n\n6.2 UMP\nConsumer \\(i\\) solves: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{x^i} u(x^i) \\\\\n&\\text{s.t. } px^i \\leq wl^i + rk^i.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nObserve that since consumers own labor and capital, their income come from renting out these factors of production. The FONC yields: \\[\nu'_j(x^i) = \\lambda_i p_j, \\quad\\forall j=1,2.\n\\tag{12}\\]\nSince \\(u'_j&gt;0\\) we must have \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) in optimality, implying that the BC binds: \\[\npx^i = wl^i + rk^i.\n\\]\nMoreover: \\[\nMRS_{1,2}^i = \\frac{p_1}{p_2},\\quad \\forall i\\in\\{A,B\\}.\n\\tag{13}\\]\nEquation 13 implies:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^i_2}{x^i_1} = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\quad \\forall i,\n\\]\nwhich together with the binding BC provide the optimal consumption bundle for each consumer as function of factor prices and endowments. In particular:\n\\[\nx_j^i = \\frac{wl^i + rk^i}{2p_j},\\quad i\\in\\{A, B\\},\\quad j\\in\\{1, 2\\}.\n\\tag{14}\\]\nDenote the total endowment \\(l=\\sum_i l^i\\) and \\(k= \\sum_i k^i.\\) By the market clearing condition for good 1: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_1^A + x_1^B &= y_1 = F^1(K_1, L_1) = K_1^a L_1^b \\\\\n\\frac{wl + rk}{2p_1} &= K_1^a L_1^b.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{15}\\]\nLikewise for the second good: \\[\n\\frac{wl + rk}{2p_2} = K_2^b L_2^a.\n\\tag{16}\\]\nDividing Equation 16 by Equation 15 side by side yields: \\[\n\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{K_2^b L_2^a}{K_1^a L_1^b}.\n\\tag{17}\\]\nNext we consider firms, who seek to maximize profits.\n\n\n6.3 PMP\nEach firm \\(j=1,2\\) solves their profit maximization problem (PMP):\n\\[\n\\max_{K_j, L_j} \\pi_j = p_j F^j(K_j, L_j) - rK_j - wL_j.\n\\tag{18}\\]\nIn optimality: \\[\np_j F_K^j = r, \\quad p_j F_L^j = w.\n\\tag{19}\\]\nHence: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{p_1}{p_2} &= \\frac{F_K^2}{F_K^1} = \\frac{F_L^2}{F_L^1} \\\\\n\\frac{p_1}{p_2}&= MRT_{1,2}^K = MRT_{1,2}^L.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{20}\\]\nThe \\(MRT^K_{1,2}\\) is the rate at which the economy transforms the second good into the first good using capital. Observe that Equation 13 and Equation 20 together say that at an optimum, the economy transforms one good for the other at the rate consumers are willing to substitute one for the other. From Equation 17 and Equation 20 and the fact that \\(a+b=1,\\) we have: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{F_K^2}{F_K^1} &= \\frac{K_2^b L_2^a}{K_1^a L_1^b} \\\\\n\\frac{b K_2^{b-1} L_2^a}{a K_1^{a-1} L_1^b} &= \\frac{K_2^b L_2^a}{K_1^a L_1^b} \\\\\n\\implies \\frac{K_2}{K_1} &= \\frac{b}{a}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{21}\\]\nWe will now solve for the CEA of this economy using the market clearing conditions.\n\n\n6.4 The CEA\nCombining Equation 21 and the market clearing condition for the capital market \\(K_1 + K_2 = k,\\) we can solve for the optimal values of capital. In particular,\n\\[\nK_1 = a k, \\quad K_2 = b k.\n\\tag{22}\\]\nFrom Equation 17 and Equation 20 and the fact that \\(a+b=1,\\) we have: \\[\n\\frac{L_2}{L_1} = \\frac{a}{b}.\n\\tag{23}\\]\nAgain, combining Equation 23 and the market clearing condition for the labor market \\(L_1 + L_2 = l,\\) we obtain:\n\\[\nL_1 = a l, \\quad L_2 = bl.\n\\tag{24}\\]\nHaving computed factor demands, we can substitute these values into Equation 17 to determine equilibrium price ratio \\(p_1/p_2\\). We can then normalize \\(p_2\\equiv 1,\\) to obtain: \\[\np_1 = \\frac{b}{a}\\left(\\frac{k}{l}\\right)^{b-a}.\n\\tag{25}\\]\nFactor prices can then be determined from Equation 19. The equilibrium allocations \\(x^A, x^B\\) can be determined by substituting factor and consumption prices into Equation 14.\n\n\n7 The social planner’s problem in a pure exchange economy\nIn a centralized economy, the benevolent social planner allocates resources in such a way that maximizes a social welfare function (weighted sum of utilities) subject to some feasibility constraints. A solution to the social planner’s problem is Pareto efficient. Mathematically, the social planner solves: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max_{(x^i)_{i\\in I}} \\sum_{i\\in I} w^i u^i(x^i) \\\\\n&\\text{s.t. } \\sum_{i\\in I} x^i_j \\leq \\sum_{i\\in I} e^i_j, \\quad \\forall j\\in J,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{26}\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) are social welfare weights. Note that there are no prices in the social planner’s problem (SPP), why is that? In a decentralized economy, selfish interest and prices guide individuals to efficient decisions. In a centralized economy, the social planner knows what is best and does not need prices as signals to allocate resources efficiently.\n\n7.0.1 The PEA in a pure exchange economy\nThe KKT conditions for the SPP’s problem: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    w^i u^i_j(x^i) &= \\lambda_j, \\quad \\forall j\\in J, \\: i\\in I, \\\\\n    \\sum_{i\\in I} x^i_j &= \\sum_{i\\in I} e^i_j, \\quad \\forall j\\in J.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConsumers have identical preferences. Hence: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nw^A u^A_j(x^A) &= w^B u^B_j(x^B) = \\lambda_j\\\\\nw^A x_j^A &= w^B x_j^B, \\\\\n\\implies \\frac{x_j^A}{x_j^B} &= \\frac{w^A}{w^B}, \\quad j=1,2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis together with the binding feasibility constraints characterize the PEA for this economy:\n\\[\nx^A = w^A e, \\quad x^B = w^B e.\n\\]\nThus in a pure exchange economy the PEA is proportional to the social weight of the individual. If the social weights are equal, the aggregate endowments will be divided equally among the consumers. In general the results will be different if social weights are different or preferences are different among consumers.\n\n\n7.1 The social planner’s problem in a production economy\nAccording to the FWT the CEA in the production economy also Pareto efficient. Let us show that the CEA is also a PEA, i.e., that the FWT is verified in this production economy. A PEA consists of a vector of consumption goods and factors of production \\((x_i)_{i\\in I}, (K_j, L_j)_{j=J}\\) that maximizes aggregate welfare subject to feasibility constraints.\n\n7.1.1 The PEA in a production economy\nThe social planner’s problem for a production economy reads:\n\\[\n\\max_{(x^i)_{i\\in I}, (K_j, L_j)_{j\\in J}} \\sum_{i\\in I} w^i u^i(x^i) \\\\\n\\text{s.t. } \\begin{cases}\n                \\sum_{i\\in I} x^i_j \\leq F(K_j, L_j), &\\forall j \\\\\n                \\sum_{j\\in J} K_j \\leq \\sum_i k^i \\equiv k \\\\\n                \\sum_{j\\in J} L_j \\leq \\sum_i l^i \\equiv l\n\\end{cases},\n\\tag{27}\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) are social welfare weights.\n\nRemark 2. Observe that the first constraint in the SPP is the feasibility constraint on each consumption good. The last two constraints are feasibility constraints on the factors of production.\n\nTo solve the SPP, we first set up the Lagrangian:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{L} &= \\sum_{i\\in I} w^i u^i(x^i) \\\\\n&+ \\sum_{j\\in J} \\lambda_j\\left[F(K_j, L_j) - \\sum_{i\\in I}x^i_j\\right] \\\\\n&+ \\mu_K (k - \\sum_{j\\in J} K_j) \\\\\n&+ \\mu_L (l - \\sum_{j\\in J} L_j).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{28}\\]\nThe FOCs yield:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x^i_j} &= 0 \\iff w^i u^i_j(x^i) = \\lambda_j, \\quad \\forall j\\in J, \\: i\\in I, \\\\\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial K_j} &= 0 \\iff \\lambda_j MPK_j = \\mu_K, \\\\\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial L_j} &= 0 \\iff \\lambda_j MPL_j = \\mu_L.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nObserve that \\(\\lambda_j&gt;0\\) for all good \\(j\\) and \\(\\mu_K&gt;0\\), \\(\\mu_L&gt;0\\), implying that the feasibility constraints bind at a PEA. From the FOC w.r.t to the consumption good we obtain: \\[\nMRS^A_{1,2}(x^A) = MRS^B_{1,2}(x^B).\n\\tag{29}\\]\nFrom the FOC w.r.t to factors:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\lambda_1 MPK_1 = \\lambda_2 MPK_2 \\iff \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2} &= MRT^K_{1,2} \\\\\n    \\lambda_1 MPL_1 = \\lambda_2 MPL_2 \\iff \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_2} &= MRT^L_{1,2} \\\\\n    \\frac{MPK_1}{MPL_1} = \\frac{MPK_2}{MPL_2} \\iff MRTS^1_{K,L} &= MRTS^2_{K,L}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThese conditions being satisfied by the CEA, implying that the CEA is also a PEA.",

    "text": "In economics, a bundle is a list or a vector of quantities of goods and services. In an \\(n\\)-good economy, each bundle \\(x\\) is an element of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). In the example below, the consumption bundle of Alex is \\(x_A = (1, 1.5)\\). If we know the prices of these goods in the economy, we can calculate the cost of his consumption as the dot product of the price vector and the consumption bundle. In addition, if we know his income, we can express his budget constraint mathematically as: \\(p\\cdot x_A \\leq I_A\\), where \\(p\\) is the price vector and \\(I_A\\) is Alex’s income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Consumption bundle with two goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning about preferences for bundles is essentially learning about how individuals compare bundles. Let us have a look at some key properties of the preference relation, namely: reflexivity, completeness, transitivity, continuity, monotonicity and (local) nonsasiation.\n\n\nBefore discussing these properties, let us fix the notations. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two consumption bundles (or alternatives) in the set \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (the set of alternatives or the choice set). Then for some individual \\(i\\):\n\nPreference relation\n\n\nPreference\nNotation\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succeq_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succ_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) is indifferent between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\sim_i y\\)\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from context that we will eliminate the letter \\(i\\) from the notations. Note that the equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\) simply means that \\(x\\succeq y\\) and \\(y\\succeq x\\) . We also refer to the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) as the weak preference relation, as opposed to the strict preference relation \\(\\succ\\).\nTo facilitate comparison, we shall also fix the following notations:\n\n\n\nNotation\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\geq y\\)\n\\(x_j \\geq y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\dots, n\\).\n\n\n\\(x \\gt y\\)\n\\(x_j &gt; y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\cdots, n\\).\n\n\n\nFor example we typically assume that goods’ prices are strictly positive \\(p\\gt 0\\), which we sometimes write \\(p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n_{++}\\). The notation \\(x\\ge y\\) means that the quantity of each good in \\(x\\) is at least as much as that in \\(y\\), whereas \\(x\\gt y\\) means that \\(x\\) has strictly more of every good than \\(y\\). The former permits \\(x=y\\) but the latter does not.\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies reflexivity if it any alternative is weakly preferred to itself, i.e., \\(x \\succeq x\\) for any \\(x\\in X\\).\n\n\n\nA preference relation over the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is complete if for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), either \\(x \\succeq y\\), \\(y \\succeq x\\), or both (\\(x \\sim y\\)). Observe that a strict preference of \\(y\\) over \\(x\\) would be equivalent to \\(x \\succeq y\\) and \\(y \\not\\succeq x\\).\nIntuitively completeness conveys the property that one can rank any two alternatives; it is not possible to answer “I don’t know” when ask to make a comparison between two bundles.\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) be three alternatives. A preference relation is said to be transitive if:\n\\[\n    A \\succeq B \\text{ and } B \\succeq C \\implies A \\succeq C.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPreferences that are both complete and transitive are said to be rational.\nCondition Equation 1 might seem obvious at first sight, but evidence of intransitivity is rather prevalent. One of the most remarkable reasons for intransitivity is framing, the idea that ranking of preferences depends on the context. For example, one might prefer a mango to an avocado when thinking of them as fruits, but might prefer an avocado to a mango when thinking of making a salad. Other causes of intransitivity include cognitive difficulty when comparing close alternatives, or when each alternative involves multiple criteria (see textbook for details).\n\n\n\nConsider two alternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). We say that the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) satisfies monotonicity if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k &\\implies A \\succeq B, \\\\\nA \\gt B &\\implies A \\succ B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nA preference relation is said to satisfy strict monotonicity if:\n\\[\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k \\implies A \\succ B.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStrict monotonicity implies that we cannot have bads in the bundle. Monotonicity implies that we cannot have all bads in the bundle, otherwise \\(A&gt;B\\) would imply the contrary. Note that a bad, as opposed to a good, is something we dislike (for e.g., trash); we pay to acquire a good, but to get rid of a bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies nonsatiation (NS) if for every bundle, there exists a strictly preferred bundle. Let \\(X\\) be the set of all alternatives or bundles, then NS implies that for any \\(A\\in X\\) there exists \\(B\\in X\\) such that:\n\\[B \\succ A\\]\n\nRemark 1. \n\nNS allows some of the items in the bundle to be bads\nNS implies that the consumer can always find something strictly better (no best bundle)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a preference relation satisfies local nonsatiation (LNS) if for every bundle there exists in strictly preferred bundle within any \\(\\epsilon\\)-distance from it (i.e. \\(B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A\\) for all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)). Mathematically,\n\\[\n        \\forall A \\in X,\\: \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0: \\: \\exists B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A \\text{ s.t. } B \\succ A.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\nRemark 2. \n\nLNS rules out thick indifference curves\nLNS is stricter than NS; in the former a better bundle must be found in any arbitrarily close alternative whereas in the latter it could be any other bundle in the choice set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a quick summary of the relationships between monotonicity, SM, NS, LNS:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{S.Monotonicity } &\\Rightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity } \\Rightarrow \\text{ LNS} \\Rightarrow \\text{ NS} \\\\\n    \\text{NS } &\\nRightarrow \\text{LNS } \\nRightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity} \\nRightarrow \\text{ S.Monotonicity}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nContinuity (together with rationality) is needed to guarantee a utility representation of a preference relation.\n\nA preference relation defined on the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is continuous if it is preserved under limits.\n\nFor any sequence \\(\\{(x^n, y^n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) with \\(x^n \\succeq y^n\\) for all \\(n\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x^n = x\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^n = y\\), it holds \\(x \\succeq y\\).\n\nIntuitively, continuous preferences mean that there can be no sudden jumps (preference reversals) in an individual preference over a sequence of bundles\nExample of violation of continuity: lexicographic preferences (See exercise)\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility was first used in the context of economics by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) as a measure of pleasure, happiness or satisfaction derived from the consumption of goods and services.\nThe utility function was first introduced by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) in the context of probability (gambling) to account for the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nTheorem 1 (Existence) If a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) is rational (complete and transitive) and continuous on the set of alternatives \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\), then it can be represented by a continuous utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}.\\)\n\nA utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to represent a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) over \\(X\\) if for all \\(A, B \\in X\\), it holds \\(A \\succeq B \\iff u(A) \\geq u(B)\\). In other words, ranking bundles is equivalent to ranking utilities assigned to them.\nLet us now look at some common properties of a utility function. Ideally, these properties should correspond to those desired of a preference relation.\n\n\n\nUtilities are ordinal (not cardinal)\n\n\\(u(A) = 2 u(B)\\) means that \\(A\\) is strictly preferred but NOT twice as preferred as \\(B\\)\nExample: IMDb Movies ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. A movie rated 8-star is better than one rated 4-star, but this doesn’t mean that the former is twice greater (maybe slightly, maybe infinitely so, we just don’t know from looking at utilities)\n\nThis implies that any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function also represents the same preference relation as as that utility function.\n\nIn particular, if \\(u\\) represents \\(\\succeq\\) then for any strictly increasing function \\(f\\), the function \\(f \\circ u\\) also represents \\(\\succeq\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two alternatives in \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then:\n\nMonotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) (weakly) increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succeq y\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) \\geq u(y)\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\nStrictly monotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) strictly increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\n\n\nExample 1 (Perfect complements) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=\\mathrm{min}\\{ax_1, bx_2\\}\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\n\nExample 2 (Perfect substitutes) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=ax_1 + bx_2\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\nSince monotonicity implies LNS (which in turns implies NS), both of these utility functions satisfy LNS and NS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Indifference set, upper and lower contour sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have stated above that LNS implies that the ICs cannot be thick since if it were the case we would be able to find a sufficiently small neighborhood in which no alternative is strictly better than any other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: LNS rules out thick IC (in gray)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we often see that the ICs are downward sloping? It is because of strict monotonicity. Indeed, let \\(u(x, y)\\) be a utility function representing strictly monotonic preferences. For simplicity suppose that \\(u\\) is differentiable, then the partial derivatives of \\(u(\\cdot)\\) with respect to each argument, \\(u_x\\) and \\(u_y\\), are strictly positive. Along an IC, the level of utility is constant. By totally differentiating, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_x dx + u_y dy &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\\frac{u_x}{u_y}\\\\\n&&lt;0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\n\n\nConvexity of preferences captures an individual’s taste for diversification. Formally, we say that preferences are convex if the upper-contour set (UCS) is a convex set.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Convex UCS (shaded) and preferences for diversification. Observe that any mix of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is strictly preferred to \\(z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nConvexity implies diminishing marginal rates of substitution, the term on the RHS of Equation 5 (in absolute value):\n\\[\nMRS_{x, y} \\equiv \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = -\\frac{dy}{dx}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe MRS captures our willingness to exchange one good for an additional unit of another.

We want to show \\(u=f(v(x))\\) for some homothetic \\(v\\) and strictly increasing function \\(f\\). Since \\(v\\) is homothetic there exists a strictly increasing function \\(h\\) and a homogeneous function \\(t\\) such that \\(v=h(t(x))\\). Hence \\(u=f(h(t(x))) = (f\\circ h) (t(x))\\) where \\(f\\circ h\\) is strictly increasing. This shows that \\(u\\) is a monotonic transformation of \\(t\\), a homog function, hence is homothetic\nThat homogeneity is not preseved under a monotonic transformation can be shown by a counter example. For instance, consider \\(u(x, y) = xy\\), which is homogeneous of degree 2 (why?), but the monotone transformation \\(f(u) = u + a\\) for some constant \\(a&gt;0\\) is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function: \\[\n  u(x, y) = [\\alpha x^p + (1 - \\alpha)y^p]^{1/p},\n\\tag{10}\\] where \\(p\\neq 0\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\).\nThe CES function is a generalization of several other functions.\n\nWhen \\(p\\) approaches 0, it becomes the Cobb-Douglas utility function\nWhen \\(p\\) approachs \\(-\\infty\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y) = \\min \\{ax, by\\}\\), the Leontief utility function\nWhen \\(p=1\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y)= ax + by\\), which represents preferences for perfect substitutes\n\nConstant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility: \\[\nu(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}, & \\sigma&gt;0,\\: \\sigma\\neq 1 \\\\\n\\ln (x), & \\sigma = 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The CRRA utility function is used extensively in models of decision making under uncertainty.",

    "text": "Learning about preferences for bundles is essentially learning about how individuals compare bundles. Let us have a look at some key properties of the preference relation, namely: reflexivity, completeness, transitivity, continuity, monotonicity and (local) nonsasiation.\n\n\nBefore discussing these properties, let us fix the notations. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two consumption bundles (or alternatives) in the set \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (the set of alternatives or the choice set). Then for some individual \\(i\\):\n\nPreference relation\n\n\nPreference\nNotation\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succeq_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succ_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) is indifferent between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\sim_i y\\)\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from context that we will eliminate the letter \\(i\\) from the notations. Note that the equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\) simply means that \\(x\\succeq y\\) and \\(y\\succeq x\\) . We also refer to the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) as the weak preference relation, as opposed to the strict preference relation \\(\\succ\\).\nTo facilitate comparison, we shall also fix the following notations:\n\n\n\nNotation\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\geq y\\)\n\\(x_j \\geq y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\dots, n\\).\n\n\n\\(x \\gt y\\)\n\\(x_j &gt; y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\cdots, n\\).\n\n\n\nFor example we typically assume that goods’ prices are strictly positive \\(p\\gt 0\\), which we sometimes write \\(p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n_{++}\\). The notation \\(x\\ge y\\) means that the quantity of each good in \\(x\\) is at least as much as that in \\(y\\), whereas \\(x\\gt y\\) means that \\(x\\) has strictly more of every good than \\(y\\). The former permits \\(x=y\\) but the latter does not.\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies reflexivity if it any alternative is weakly preferred to itself, i.e., \\(x \\succeq x\\) for any \\(x\\in X\\).\n\n\n\nA preference relation over the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is complete if for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), either \\(x \\succeq y\\), \\(y \\succeq x\\), or both (\\(x \\sim y\\)). Observe that a strict preference of \\(y\\) over \\(x\\) would be equivalent to \\(x \\succeq y\\) and \\(y \\not\\succeq x\\).\nIntuitively completeness conveys the property that one can rank any two alternatives; it is not possible to answer “I don’t know” when ask to make a comparison between two bundles.\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) be three alternatives. A preference relation is said to be transitive if:\n\\[\n    A \\succeq B \\text{ and } B \\succeq C \\implies A \\succeq C.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPreferences that are both complete and transitive are said to be rational.\nCondition Equation 1 might seem obvious at first sight, but evidence of intransitivity is rather prevalent. One of the most remarkable reasons for intransitivity is framing, the idea that ranking of preferences depends on the context. For example, one might prefer a mango to an avocado when thinking of them as fruits, but might prefer an avocado to a mango when thinking of making a salad. Other causes of intransitivity include cognitive difficulty when comparing close alternatives, or when each alternative involves multiple criteria (see textbook for details).\n\n\n\nConsider two alternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). We say that the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) satisfies monotonicity if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k &\\implies A \\succeq B, \\\\\nA \\gt B &\\implies A \\succ B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nA preference relation is said to satisfy strict monotonicity if:\n\\[\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k \\implies A \\succ B.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStrict monotonicity implies that we cannot have bads in the bundle. Monotonicity implies that we cannot have all bads in the bundle, otherwise \\(A&gt;B\\) would imply the contrary. Note that a bad, as opposed to a good, is something we dislike (for e.g., trash); we pay to acquire a good, but to get rid of a bad.\n\n\n\n\n\nA preference relation satisfies nonsatiation (NS) if for every bundle, there exists a strictly preferred bundle. Let \\(X\\) be the set of all alternatives or bundles, then NS implies that for any \\(A\\in X\\) there exists \\(B\\in X\\) such that:\n\\[B \\succ A\\]\n\nRemark 1. \n\nNS allows some of the items in the bundle to be bads\nNS implies that the consumer can always find something strictly better (no best bundle)\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, a preference relation satisfies local nonsatiation (LNS) if for every bundle there exists in strictly preferred bundle within any \\(\\epsilon\\)-distance from it (i.e. \\(B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A\\) for all \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)). Mathematically,\n\\[\n        \\forall A \\in X,\\: \\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0: \\: \\exists B \\in N_{\\epsilon} A \\text{ s.t. } B \\succ A.\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\nRemark 2. \n\nLNS rules out thick indifference curves\nLNS is stricter than NS; in the former a better bundle must be found in any arbitrarily close alternative whereas in the latter it could be any other bundle in the choice set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a quick summary of the relationships between monotonicity, SM, NS, LNS:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{S.Monotonicity } &\\Rightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity } \\Rightarrow \\text{ LNS} \\Rightarrow \\text{ NS} \\\\\n    \\text{NS } &\\nRightarrow \\text{LNS } \\nRightarrow \\text{ Monotonicity} \\nRightarrow \\text{ S.Monotonicity}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nContinuity (together with rationality) is needed to guarantee a utility representation of a preference relation.\n\nA preference relation defined on the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is continuous if it is preserved under limits.\n\nFor any sequence \\(\\{(x^n, y^n)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\) with \\(x^n \\succeq y^n\\) for all \\(n\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x^n = x\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y^n = y\\), it holds \\(x \\succeq y\\).\n\nIntuitively, continuous preferences mean that there can be no sudden jumps (preference reversals) in an individual preference over a sequence of bundles\nExample of violation of continuity: lexicographic preferences (See exercise)",

In other words, ranking bundles is equivalent to ranking utilities assigned to them.\nLet us now look at some common properties of a utility function. Ideally, these properties should correspond to those desired of a preference relation.\n\n\n\nUtilities are ordinal (not cardinal)\n\n\\(u(A) = 2 u(B)\\) means that \\(A\\) is strictly preferred but NOT twice as preferred as \\(B\\)\nExample: IMDb Movies ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. A movie rated 8-star is better than one rated 4-star, but this doesn’t mean that the former is twice greater (maybe slightly, maybe infinitely so, we just don’t know from looking at utilities)\n\nThis implies that any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function also represents the same preference relation as as that utility function.\n\nIn particular, if \\(u\\) represents \\(\\succeq\\) then for any strictly increasing function \\(f\\), the function \\(f \\circ u\\) also represents \\(\\succeq\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two alternatives in \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\).

As in the case of homogeneity, we can also talk about homothetic preferences.\n\nDefinition 6 (Homothetic preference) A preference relation is homothetic if it can be represented by a homothetic utility function (Definition 5).\n\nSince a homogeneous utility function is homothetic, homogeneous preferences are also homothetic, but the converse is not true.\n\n\n\nICs are radial expansion of the origin: \\(x \\sim y \\implies \\alpha x \\sim \\alpha y\\) for all scalar \\(\\alpha &gt;  0\\)\nMRS is homogeneous of degree \\(0\\): The rate at which the individual substitutes one good for another depends only on the proportion of the two goods consumed, and not on:\n\nthe utility level obtained\nthe absolute quantities of the goods\n\nHomotheticity is preserved under a monotonic transformation, while homogeneity is not\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\nSuppose \\(u\\) is homothetic. We want to show \\(u=f(v(x))\\) for some homothetic \\(v\\) and strictly increasing function \\(f\\). Since \\(v\\) is homothetic there exists a strictly increasing function \\(h\\) and a homogeneous function \\(t\\) such that \\(v=h(t(x))\\). Hence \\(u=f(h(t(x))) = (f\\circ h) (t(x))\\) where \\(f\\circ h\\) is strictly increasing. This shows that \\(u\\) is a monotonic transformation of \\(t\\), a homog function, hence is homothetic\nThat homogeneity is not preseved under a monotonic transformation can be shown by a counter example. For instance, consider \\(u(x, y) = xy\\), which is homogeneous of degree 2 (why?), but the monotone transformation \\(f(u) = u + a\\) for some constant \\(a&gt;0\\) is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function: \\[\n  u(x, y) = [\\alpha x^p + (1 - \\alpha)y^p]^{1/p},\n\\tag{10}\\] where \\(p\\neq 0\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\).\nThe CES function is a generalization of several other functions.\n\nWhen \\(p\\) approaches 0, it becomes the Cobb-Douglas utility function\nWhen \\(p\\) approachs \\(-\\infty\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y) = \\min \\{ax, by\\}\\), the Leontief utility function\nWhen \\(p=1\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y)= ax + by\\), which represents preferences for perfect substitutes\n\nConstant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility: \\[\nu(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}, & \\sigma&gt;0,\\: \\sigma\\neq 1 \\\\\n\\ln (x), & \\sigma = 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The CRRA utility function is used extensively in models of decision making under uncertainty.",

    "text": "7.2 Cost minimization problem (CMP)\nThe cost minimization problem entails finding a combination of inputs such that the total cost to attain a certain level of output is minimized.\n\nDefinition 2 (CMP) \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\min_{L,K} C = wL + rK \\\\\n&\\text{s.t. } q(L, K) \\geq m,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\] where \\(m\\) is the target output level.\n\nThe idea is to identify the isocost line touching the isoquant that is as close to the origin as possible.\n\n7.2.1 Necessary conditions\nThe Lagrangian of the CMP: \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(\\lambda, L, K) = - C(L, K) + \\lambda (q(L,K) - m).\n\\tag{9}\\]\nAccording to the KTT theorem, if \\((L^*, K^*)\\) is a solution to the CMP, then there exist \\(\\lambda^* \\geq 0\\) such that:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\mathcal{L}_L (L^*, K^*, \\lambda^*) \\leq 0, \\quad\n\\mathcal{L}_K (L^*, K^*, \\lambda^*) \\leq 0\\\\\n&\\quad \\quad \\quad \\text{ with equality for interior solutions }\\\\\n&\\lambda^* \\geq 0, \\quad \\lambda^*(q(L^*, K^*) - m) = 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nAssuming interior solutions1, the FOCs yield:\nThis implies: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{MP_L}{MP_K} &= \\frac{w}{r} \\\\\n\\frac{MP_L}{w} &= \\frac{MP_K}{r}=\\frac{1}{\\lambda^*}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nNote that \\(\\lambda^*\\) can be interpreted as a shadow price: the cost of increasing output by a unit: \\[\n\\lambda^* = \\frac{\\partial C^*(r,w,m)}{\\partial m}.\n\\]\nEquation 12 states that when minimizing the production cost, the firm rearranges inputs in such manner that the marginal product per currency unit is equalized across all factors. If for example \\(\\frac{MP_L}{w} &gt; \\frac{MP_K}{r}\\) then we should increase \\(L\\) by reducing \\(K\\) since the former has greater bang for the buck. The condition \\(\\frac{MP_L}{MP_K} = \\frac{w}{r} \\iff MRTS_{L,K} = \\frac{w}{r}\\) tells us that the interior optimum is located where the isoquant is tangent to the isocost.",

    "text": "7.4 Types of costs:\n\n7.4.1 Explicit vs implicit costs\n\nExplicit costs: Costs that require monetary payments\nImplicit costs: Do not require monetary outlays but reflect opportunity costs\nExample: What is your cost of attending this course?\n\nExplicit cost: tuition, transportation, etc.\nImplicit cost: the salary you could have earned during the time of study\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Sunk vs nonsunk costs\n\nSunk costs: costs that cannot be recoverred even if the firm chooses to shut down its operations.\n\nExamples: Advertising expenses already spent, the rent the firm has already paid for the building if the lease does not allow subletting\n\nNonsunk costs: costs that can be sold back (recoverable or partially recoverable costs) in case the firm shuts down\n\nExample: Raw materials, the rental cost of the building if the contract allows subleases\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Long-run vs short-run costs\n\nIn the long run (LR), the firm has enough time to vary the amount of all inputs as much as necessary\nIn the short run (SR), the amount of at least one input is fixed\nExample: In short run, production factors such as land or capital are typically fixed, whereas labor is variable. In the long run, it is possible to buy more land and set up new factories, allowing all factors of production to vary.\n\nConsider a firm with Cobb-Douglas production \\(q = L^a K^b\\) where \\(K=\\bar{K}&gt;0\\) is fixed in the SR. Thus the cost function found above is the LR cost. The SR cost can be found by solving the CMP with respect to \\(L\\) only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Short-run vs long-run cost function\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.4 Average and marginal costs\n\n\nAverage cost (AC): total cost of production per output unit:\n\\[\n  AC(q) = \\frac{C(q)}{q},\n   \\tag{14}\\] where \\(C(q)\\) is the total cost.\nMarginal cost (MC): the rate at which the total cost increases as the firm produces an additional unit of output. Graphically it is the slope of the total cost curve:\n\\[\n  MC(q) = C'(q)\n   \\tag{15}\\] in the continuous case.2\nThe MC curve crosses the AC curve at the AC’s minimum. In other words, the AC is decreasing when it is above the MC and increasing when it is above the MC.\nIntuition:\n\nInitially when output is small, the variable cost is small and the fixed cost dominates the total cost\nAs output increases, the importance of fixed cost declines. Meanwhile, the MC increases (due to decreasing marginal product)\nAfter a threshold, producing an additional unit costs more than the AC of existing units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Short-run average and marginal costs",

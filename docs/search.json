Searching for an equilibrium is essentially searching for prices that equalize demand and supply in the market. When a single market is considered in isolation, its equilibrium is a partial one. When all markets are considered, we speak of a general equilibrium. In a pure exchange economy, all markets are markets of consumption goods. In a production economy, the relevant markets include those of factors of production such as labor, capital and land. In this course, we will be mostly interested in general equilibria in a pure exchange economy."

Assume that it has a Cobb-Douglas production function defined by \\(q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2}\\). The factor prices are \\(w=\\$40\\) and \\(r=\\$10\\) as before.\n\nStep 1: Solve the CMP:\n\\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  &\\min_{K,L} 40L + 10K \\\\\n  \\text{s.t. } &q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2} \\geq q,\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\nfor some target output level \\(q\\).\n\nThe cost function can be obtained by replacing the solutions of the CMP into the objective function. This yields:\n\n\\[\n  C(q) = 40q.\n  \\]\nStep 2: Substitute \\(C(q)\\) obtained from the CMP into the PMP so that this problem reads:\n\\[\n  \\max_{q\\geq0} \\pi(q) = pq - 40q = (p - 40)q.\n  \\]\n\nClearly if \\(p&lt;40\\) the firm should shut down\nIf \\(p\\geq 40\\), the firm produces as much as possible since the profit is then incresing in output\nWe thus obtain a perfectly elastic individual supply curve\nNote that this is the long-run individual supply curve since all inputs are variable.

Observe that this is a short-run cost function since fixed costs (\\(c\\)) are present. The profit maximizing condition for the firm is: \\[\nC'(q) = a q + b = p \\iff q = \\frac{p - b}{a}.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nTo determine the short-run supply curve of the firm, we need to understand the nature of the fixed costs represented by \\(c.\\) In the short-run, firms are typically do not try to make positive profits, i.e., they do not need to sell each unit for at least their average total cost. Firms only need to recuperate the non-sunk part of the fixed cost. Sunk costs are fixed costs that cannot be recovered by the firm and thus should not affect its decision on future output. For example, advertising costs once spent cannot be recovered. Lease payments, on the other hand, are non-sunk fixed costs can be recovered by sublease if the firm eventually decides to shut down.\nFor simplicity, suppose that \\(c\\) is non-sunk. The average total cost in this case is equal to the average non-sunk total cost (ANSC).The firm produces so long as the market price is above the ANSC: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(q^*) &gt; 0 &\\iff p &gt; \\frac{C(q^*)}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; 0.5 a q^* + b + \\frac{c}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; 0.5 a \\frac{p - b}{a} + b + \\frac{ca}{p - b} \\\\\n&\\iff (p - b)^2 &gt; 2ca \\\\\n&\\iff p &gt; b + \\sqrt{2ca}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nObserve that the last line follows from the fact that \\(q^* &gt; 0\\) if and only if \\(p &gt; b\\) in view of Equation 1. This condition tells us that in the SR, the firm suffers from a fixed cost (\\(c\\)), which might prevent it from earning positive profits even if it is operating optimally.

In other words, to construct the SR market supply curve, one adds up the quantities supplied by all the firms in the market at each given price. The market demand curve is constructed in the same manner. By equating supply and demand, we can determine the market equilibrium.\n\nExample 3 Suppose the market demand is given by \\(q^D(p) = 100 - 2p.\\) Consider a market with \\(N\\) identical firms, each facing the same cost function \\(C(q)=10−5q+2q^2.\\) In view of Exercise 1, the SR market supply is given by: \\[\nq^S(p) =\n\\begin{cases} N(p/4 + 5/4) & p &gt; 4\\sqrt{2.5}-5\\approx 1.32 \\\\\n                     0 & \\mathrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIn equilibrium \\(q^S(p) = q^D(p)\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n100 - 2p &= N(p/4 + 5/4) \\\\\np &= \\frac{5(80 - N)}{8 + N}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Hence the market price is a decreasing function of the number of firms.

    "section": "The preference relation",
    "text": "The preference relation\nLearning about preferences for bundles is essentially learning about how individuals compare bundles. Let us have a look at some key properties of the preference relation, namely: reflexivity, completeness, transitivity, continuity, monotonicity and (local) nonsasiation.\n\nNotations\nBefore discussing these properties, let us fix the notations. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two consumption bundles (or alternatives) in the set \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (the set of alternatives or the choice set). Then for some individual \\(i\\):\n\nPreference relation\n\n\nPreference\nNotation\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succeq_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) over \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\succ_i y\\)\n\n\n\\(i\\) is indifferent between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\\(x \\sim_i y\\)\n\n\n\nWhen it is clear from context that we will eliminate the letter \\(i\\) from the notations. Note that the equivalence relation \\(\\sim\\) simply means that \\(x\\succeq y\\) and \\(y\\succeq x\\) . We also refer to the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) as the weak preference relation, as opposed to the strict preference relation \\(\\succ\\).\nTo facilitate comparison, we shall also fix the following notations:\n\n\n\nNotation\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(x \\geq y\\)\n\\(x_j \\geq y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\dots, n\\).\n\n\n\\(x \\gt y\\)\n\\(x_j &gt; y_j\\) for all good \\(j=1,2, \\cdots, n\\).\n\n\n\nFor example we typically assume that goods’ prices are strictly positive \\(p\\gg 0\\), which we sometimes write \\(p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n_{++}\\). The notation \\(x\\ge y\\) means that the quantity of each good in \\(x\\) is at least as much as that in \\(y\\), whereas \\(x\\gt y\\) means that \\(x\\) has strictly more of every good than \\(y\\). The former permits \\(x=y\\) but the latter does not.\n\n\nReflexivity\nA preference relation satisfies reflexivity if it any alternative is weakly preferred to itself, i.e., \\(x \\succeq x\\) for any \\(x\\in X\\).\n\n\nCompleteness\nA preference relation over the set of alternatives \\(X\\) is complete if for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), either \\(x \\succeq y\\), \\(y \\succeq x\\), or both (\\(x \\sim y\\)). Observe that a strict preference of \\(y\\) over \\(x\\) would be equivalent to \\(x \\succeq y\\) and \\(y \\not\\succeq x\\).\nIntuitively completeness conveys the property that one can rank any two alternatives; it is not possible to answer “I don’t know” when ask to make a comparison between two bundles.\n\n\nTransitivity\nLet \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) be three alternatives. A preference relation is said to be transitive if:\n\\[\n    A \\succeq B \\text{ and } B \\succeq C \\implies A \\succeq C.\n\\tag{1}\\]\nPreferences that are both complete and transitive are said to be rational.\nCondition Equation 1 might seem obvious at first sight, but evidence of intransitivity is rather prevalent. One of the most remarkable reasons for intransitivity is framing, the idea that ranking of preferences depends on the context. For example, one might prefer a mango to an avocado when thinking of them as fruits, but might prefer an avocado to a mango when thinking of making a salad. Other causes of intransitivity include cognitive difficulty when comparing close alternatives, or when each alternative involves multiple criteria (see textbook for details).\n\n\nMonotonicity\nConsider two alternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). We say that the preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) satisfies monotonicity if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k &\\implies A \\succeq B, \\\\\nA \\gt B &\\implies A \\succ B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nA preference relation is said to satisfy strict monotonicity if:\n\\[\nA \\geq B \\text{ and } a_k \\neq b_k \\text{ for some } k \\implies A \\succ B.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nStrict monotonicity implies that we cannot have bads in the bundle.

    "text": "Utility functions\nUtility was first used in the context of economics by Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) as a measure of pleasure, happiness or satisfaction derived from the consumption of goods and services.\nThe utility function was first introduced by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) in the context of probability (gambling) to account for the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nTheorem 1 (Existence) If a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) is rational (complete and transitive) and continuous on the set of alternatives \\(X\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\), then it can be represented by a continuous utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}.\\)\n\nA utility function \\(u: X \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to represent a preference relation \\(\\succeq\\) over \\(X\\) if for all \\(A, B \\in X\\), it holds \\(A \\succeq B \\iff u(A) \\geq u(B)\\). In other words, ranking bundles is equivalent to ranking utilities assigned to them.\nLet us now look at some common properties of a utility function. Ideally, these properties should correspond to those desired of a preference relation.\n\nOrdinality\n\nUtilities are ordinal (not cardinal)\n\n\\(u(A) = 2 u(B)\\) means that \\(A\\) is strictly preferred but NOT twice as preferred as \\(B\\)\nExample: IMDb Movies ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. A movie rated 8-star is better than one rated 4-star, but this doesn’t mean that the former is twice greater (maybe slightly, maybe infinitely so, we just don’t know from looking at utilities)\n\nThis implies that any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function also represents the same preference relation as as that utility function.\n\nIn particular, if \\(u\\) represents \\(\\succeq\\) then for any strictly increasing function \\(f\\), the function \\(f \\circ u\\) also represents \\(\\succeq\\).\n\n\n\n\nMonotonicity\nLet \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be two alternatives in \\(X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then:\n\nMonotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) (weakly) increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succeq y\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) \\geq u(y)\\) and \\(x \\gt y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\nStrictly monotonic preferences \\(\\iff\\) strictly increasing utility functions\n\nPreferences: \\(x \\geq y \\implies x \\succ y\\)\nUtility: \\(x \\geq y \\implies u(x) &gt; u(y)\\)\n\n\n\nExample 1 (Perfect complements) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=\\mathrm{min}\\{ax_1, bx_2\\}\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\n\nExample 2 (Perfect substitutes) The utility function \\(u: X\\subset\\mathbb{R^2}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(u(x_1, x_2)=ax_1 + bx_2\\) where \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\) represents a monotonic but not strictly monotonic preference relation.\n\nSince monotonicity implies LNS (which in turns implies NS), both of these utility functions satisfy LNS and NS.",

It is because of strict monotonicity. Indeed, let \\(u(x, y)\\) be a utility function representing strictly monotonic preferences. For simplicity suppose that \\(u\\) is differentiable, then the partial derivatives of \\(u(\\cdot)\\) with respect to each argument, \\(u_x\\) and \\(u_y\\), are strictly positive. Along an IC, the level of utility is constant. By totally differentiating, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_x dx + u_y dy &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\\frac{u_x}{u_y}\\\\\n&&lt;0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\n\n\nConvexity of preferences\nConvexity of preferences captures an individual’s taste for diversification. Formally, we say that preferences are convex if the upper-contour set (UCS) is a convex set.1\n\nmm.plot_convex_UCS()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Convex UCS (shaded) and preferences for diversification. Observe that any mix of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is strictly preferred to \\(z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nConvexity implies diminishing marginal rates of substitution, the term on the RHS of Equation 5 (in absolute value):\n\\[\nMRS_{x, y} \\equiv \\frac{u_x}{u_y} = -\\frac{dy}{dx}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe MRS captures our willingness to exchange one good for an additional unit of another. In particular, \\(MRS_{x,y}\\) captures the amount of good \\(y\\) the individual is willing to give up for an additional unit of good \\(x\\) in order to maintain the same level of utility. The intuition behind a decreasing MRS is that as one good gets abundant, we are willing to sacrifice less of the other good for an additional unit of the abundant good. This is due to the preference for variety captured by convexity.\n\nmm.plotMRS()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diminishing marginal rates of substitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcavity and quasiconcavity\n\nDefinition 1 (Quasiconcavity 1) A utility function defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x \\in X\\), the upper contour set of \\(x\\), defined by \\(\\mathrm{UCS}(x) = \\{y \\in X: u(y) \\geq u(x)\\}\\), is convex.\n\nAn alternative definition of quasiconcavity is the following.\n\nDefinition 2 (Quasiconcavity 2) A utility function \\(u\\) defined on a convex set \\(X\\) is quasiconcave if for all \\(x, y \\in X\\): \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) \\geq \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\] It is strictly quasiconcave if: \\[ u(\\alpha x + (1 - \\alpha) y) &gt; \\min\\{u(x), u(y)\\}. \\]\n\nIt is easy to see that concavity implies quasiconcavity (proof as exercise). Quasiconcavity is preserved under a monotone transformation, which makes it a desirable property of utility functions. This is not true for concavity.\nThe converse is not true. For example, consider the Cobb-Douglas utility function \\(u=x^a y^b\\), where \\(a,b&gt;0\\). Suppose \\(a=b=1/4\\), then \\(u\\) is strictly concave, hence is also quasiconcave. For \\(a=b=3/2\\), the utility function is quasiconcave but not concave.\n\ndef plotIC(alph, name='', lab=False):\n    x = np.linspace(0, 2.5, 50)\n    y = np.linspace(0, 2.5, 50)\n    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n    U = mm.cobb_douglas(X, Y, alph, alph)\n    # fig = plt.figure(figsize=plt.figaspect(.5))\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n    fig.suptitle(name)\n    \n    ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1)\n    ax = plt.contour(X, Y, U, levels=np.arange(.5,  2, .25), \n                      # colors='k',\n                 # cmap='coolwarm', \n                     cmap='plasma',\n                    #   linewidth=2\n                      )\n    if lab:\n        plt.clabel(ax, inline=True, fontsize=10)\n    # plt.colorbar(ax)\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2, projection=\"3d\")\n    ax.plot_surface(X, Y, U, edgecolor='white', \n                    # color='k',\n                    cmap=cm.plasma,\n                    lw=.5, \n                    rstride=4, \n                    cstride=4, \n                    alpha=.8\n                   )\n    plt.show()\n\n\nplotIC(.25, name='$u=x^{0.25}y^{0.25}$', lab=True)\n\n\n\n\nConcave utility function and indifference curves\n\n\n\n\n\nplotIC(1.5, name='$u=x^{1.5}y^{1.5}$', lab=True)\n\n\n\n\nQuasiconcave utility function and indifference curves",

Importantly, homotheticity is preserved under a monotone transformation whereas homogeneity is not. It is thus a desirable property of utility functions. As in the case of homogeneity, we can also talk about homothetic preferences.\n\nDefinition 6 (Homothetic preference) A preference relation is homothetic if it can be represented by a homothetic utility function (Definition 5).\n\nSince a homogeneous utility function is homothetic, homogeneous preferences are also homothetic, but the converse is not true.\n\nProperties\n\nICs are radial expansion of the origin: \\(x \\sim y \\implies \\alpha x \\sim \\alpha y\\) for all scalar \\(\\alpha &gt;  0\\)\nMRS is homogeneous of degree \\(0\\): The rate at which the individual substitutes one good for another depends only on the proportion of the two goods consumed, and not on:\n\nthe utility level obtained\nthe absolute quantities of the goods\n\nHomotheticity is preserved under a monotonic transformation, while homogeneity is not\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\nSuppose \\(u\\) is homothetic. We want to show \\(u=f(v(x))\\) for some homothetic \\(v\\) and strictly increasing function \\(f\\). Since \\(v\\) is homothetic there exists a strictly increasing function \\(h\\) and a homogeneous function \\(t\\) such that \\(v=h(t(x))\\). Hence \\(u=f(h(t(x))) = (f\\circ h) (t(x))\\) where \\(f\\circ h\\) is strictly increasing. This shows that \\(u\\) is a monotonic transformation of \\(t\\), a homog function, hence is homothetic\nThat homogeneity is not preseved under a monotonic transformation can be shown by a counter example. For instance, consider \\(u(x, y) = xy\\), which is homogeneous of degree 2 (why?), but the monotone transformation \\(f(u) = u + a\\) for some constant \\(a&gt;0\\) is not.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nConstant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function: \\[\n  u(x, y) = [\\alpha x^p + (1 - \\alpha)y^p]^{1/p},\n\\tag{10}\\] where \\(p\\neq 0\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in (0, 1)\\).\nThe CES function is a generalization of several other functions.\n\nWhen \\(p\\) approaches 0, it becomes the Cobb-Douglas utility function\nWhen \\(p\\) approachs \\(-\\infty\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y) = \\min \\{ax, by\\}\\), the Leontief utility function\nWhen \\(p=1\\), we obtain \\(u(x, y)= ax + by\\), which represents preferences for perfect substitutes\n\nConstant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility: \\[\nu(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}, & \\sigma&gt;0,\\: \\sigma\\neq 1 \\\\\n\\ln (x), & \\sigma = 1.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The CRRA utility function is used extensively in models of decision making under uncertainty.",

    "text": "Types of costs:\n\nExplicit vs implicit costs\n\nExplicit costs: Costs that require monetary payments\nImplicit costs: Do not require monetary outlays but reflect opportunity costs\nExample: What is your cost of attending this course?\n\nExplicit cost: tuition, transportation, etc.\nImplicit cost: the salary you could have earned during the time of study\n\n\n\n\nSunk vs nonsunk costs\n\nSunk costs: costs that cannot be recoverred even if the firm chooses to shut down its operations.\n\nExample: The rental the firm has already paid for the building if the lease does not allow subletting\nThis means that there is a fixed positive cost that the firm incurs even in the case of no production\n\nNonsunk costs: costs that can be sold back (recoverable or partially recoverable costs) in case the firm shuts down\n\nExample: Raw materials\n\n\n\n\nLong-run vs short-run costs\n\nIn the long run (LR), the firm has enough time to vary the amount of all inputs as much as necessary\nIn the short run (SR), the amount of at least one input is fixed\nExample: In short run, production factors such as land or capital are typically fixed, whereas labor is variable. In the long run, it is possible to buy more land and set up new factories, allowing all factors of production to vary.\n\nConsider a firm with Cobb-Douglas production \\(q = L^a K^b\\) where \\(K=\\bar{K}&gt;0\\) is fixed in the SR. Thus the cost function found above is the LR cost. The SR cost can be found by solving the CMP with respect to \\(L\\) only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef TCSR(q):\n    return 1500 + (4 / 15) * q ** 2\n\ndef TCLR(q):\n    return 40 * q\n\ndef ACSR(q):\n    return TCSR(q) / q\n\ndef ACLR(q):\n    return TCLR(q) / q\n\ndef MCSR(q):\n    return (8 / 15) * q\n\ndef MCLR(q):\n    return 40\n\nq = np.arange(1, 200)\n# plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nplt.plot(q, TCSR(q), label='Short-run total cost')\nplt.plot(q, TCLR(q), label='Long-run total cost')\n# plt.title('$w=40$ and $r=10$')\nplt.xlabel('Units of output')\nplt.ylabel('Total cost')\nplt.legend(loc=0)\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Short-run vs long-run cost function\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage and marginal costs\n\n\nAverage cost (AC): total cost of production per output unit:\n\\[\n  AC(q) = \\frac{C(q)}{q},\n   \\tag{14}\\] where \\(C(q)\\) is the total cost.\nMarginal cost (MC): the rate at which the total cost increases as the firm produces an additional unit of output. Graphically it is the slope of the total cost curve:\n\\[\n  MC(q) = C'(q)\n   \\tag{15}\\] in the continuous case.1\nThe MC curve crosses the AC curve at the AC’s minimum. In other words, the AC is decreasing when it is above the MC and increasing when it is above the MC.\nIntuition:\n\nInitially when output is small, the variable cost is small and the fixed cost dominates the total cost\nAs output increases, the importance of fixed cost declines. Meanwhile, the MC increases (due to decreasing marginal product)\nAfter a threshold, producing an additional unit costs more than the AC of existing units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq = np.arange(30, 150, 1)\n# plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(q, ACSR(q), label='Short-run average cost')\nplt.plot(q, MCSR(q), label='Short-run marginal cost')\nplt.legend(loc=0)\nplt.xlabel('Units of output')\nplt.ylabel('AC, MC')\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Short-run average and marginal costs",

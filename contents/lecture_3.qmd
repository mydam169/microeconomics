In this chapter we will be examining market equilibria. We shall begin by deriving the market supply curve, which results from firms' optimal production decision. Likewise, market demand results from consumers' optimal consumption decision. Searching for an equilibrium is essentially searching for prices that equalize demand and supply in the market. When a single market is considered in isolation, its equilibrium is a partial one. When all markets are considered, we speak of a general equilibrium. In a pure exchange economy, all markets are markets of consumption goods. In  a production economy, the relevant markets include those of factors of production such as labor, capital and land. In this course, we will be mostly interested in general equilibria in a pure exchange economy. 

# Perfectly competitive markets

Our markets in this chapter are perfectly competitive, their features are:

* Fragmentation: large number of producers and consumers whose decisions (to produce or consume) do not influence market prices of the goods. In other words, all market participants are price-takers

* Undifferentiated products: products of all firms in the same industry are regarded as identical by consumers

* Perfect information: information on prices are transparent and freely accessible by consumers

* Free entry and exit: in the long run (LR), firms can freely enter and exit 

Example: Wheat, corn, or agricultural commodities

# Firm's profit maxmimization problem (PMP)

## The PMP

<!-- * Is the dual problem of the cost minimization problem (CMP) introduced previously
    * In that problem, we implicitly assumed that firms were price-takers in the markets of inputs -->

::: {#def-PMP}
## Firm's PMP
Consider a price-taking firm in the market of the output good
Given $p$, the market price of the good, every firm's PMP is:
$$
\max_{q\geq 0} \pi = R(q) - C(q) = pq - C(q), 
$$
where $C(q)$ is the total cost function derived from the CMP introduced previously, $R(q)$ denotes the total revenue. 
:::
    
Observe that the PMP includes the CMP as a first step

## Necessary conditions

According to the KT conditions, either 

* we have a corner solution $q=0$, or

* We have an interior solution $q>0$ satisfying the FOC:

    $$
        \pi'(q) = 0 \iff p = C'(q) \\
        \iff p = MC(q).
    $$
    
* Observe that for a price-taking firm, the marginal revenue is the market price of the good (as we shall see later, for a firm with market power, the marginal revenue is _less_ than the price)

* The FOC above implies that the firm produces up to a point where the marginal revenue (marginal benefit) is equal to the marginal cost. 
    
## Sufficient condition

* The FOC is sufficient for a max if the profit function is concave  in output. This is called the second-order condition (SOC)

* We have:

    $$ \pi''(q) = -C''(q), $$
    
    implying that the SOC is satisfied whenever the cost function is convex in $q$ (i.e., whenever the MC is increasing in output)


    
## Example

Let us solve the PMP of a price-taking firm in the output market (and inputs market). Assume that it has a Cobb-Douglas production function defined by $q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2}$. The factor prices are $w=\$40$ and $r=\$10$ as before.

* Step 1: Solve the CMP:

    $$\min_{K,L} 40L + 10K \\
    \text{s.t. } q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2} \geq q, 
    $$
    
    for some target output level $q$. 
    
    * The cost function can be obtained by replacing the solutions of the CMP into the objective function. This yields: 
    
    $$
    C(q) = 40q.
    $$

* Step 2: Substitute $C(q)$ obtained from the CMP into the PMP so that this problem reads:

    $$
    \max_{q\geq0} \pi(q) = pq - 40q = (p - 40)q. 
    $$
    
    * Clearly if $p<40$ the firm should shut down
    
    * If $p\geq 40$, the firm produces as much as possible since the profit is then incresing in output
    
    * We thus obtain a perfectly elastic individual supply curve

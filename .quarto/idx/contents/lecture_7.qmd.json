The firm's productive activities generate negative externalities that affect the consumer.\n\n### The representative firm\n\nThe firm's objective is to maximize profit $\\pi(x,p)$ where $p$ is the price vector and $x$ the amount of externality generated. In a competitive market the firm is a price taker, taking $p$ as given, allowing us to write the profit function s $\\pi(x).$ We assume that the profit functionis twice differentiable, increasing and concave:\n\n$$\n\\pi'(x) > 0 > \\pi''(x).\n$${#eq-assumption-profit}\n\nIn words, we assume that profits increase with externalities since the firm does not bear the full marginal cost of production. Nevertheless, the marginal benefits of pollution decline. Note that since externalities are generated by production, making decision on externalities can be considered equivalent to making decision on output, as illustrated in @exm-eqm-ext.\n\n### The reprsentative consumer\n\nThe consumer has preferences reprsented by an utility function $u(q,x),$ where $q\\in\\mathbb{R}_+^n$ is the consumption bundle, the vector of _tradable goods_, and $x$ is the negative externatlity, which is _not tradable_ (otherwise it would have had a price and the impact would have been internalized!). We assume:\n\n$$\nu_k \\equiv \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial q_k} \\geq 0,\\quad \\forall k=1,\\dots,n.\n$${#eq-assume-u-q}\n\nand\n\n$$\nu_x \\equiv \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\lt 0.\n$${#eq-assum-u-x}\n\nDenote $w$ the consumer's income and $q^*(p,w,x)$ the Walrasian demand function. Then the indirect utility function (the maximized utility function) is:\n\n$$\n    v(x) = u(q*(p,w,x),x).\n$${#eq-indirect-u}\n\nObserve that $v'(x)<0$ for all $x>0.$\n\n### Competitive and pareto equilibrium externality\n\nIn a competitive equilibrium, the firm selects the (private) level of externatlity that maximizes its profits:\n\n$$\nx^P = \\arg\\max_{x\\geq 0} \\pi(x),\n$${#eq-firm-CE}\n\nThe FOC of which yields (for an interior solution):\n\n$$\n\\pi'(x^P) = 0,.\n$${#eq-foc-CE}\n\n\nIn a Pareto equilibrium, the social planner selects the level of externality that maximizes the sum of profits and utilities:\n\n$$\nx^E = \\arg\\max_{x\\geq 0} \\pi(x) + v(x).\n$${#eq-SP}\n\nThe necessary condition for an iterior solution is:\n\n$$\n\\pi'(x^E) = - v'(x^E).\n$${#eq-FOC-SP}\n\nIn other words, the social planner selects a level of externality such that the marginal benefit derived from it by the firm is equal to the marignal cost (disutility) suffered by the consumer.\n\nSince $v'(x)<0,$ and $\\pi''(x)<0,$ we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi'(x^E) > 0 &= \\pi'(x^P) \\\\\nx^E &< x^P.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence the Pareto efficient level of pollution, $x^E$ is less than the competitve level $x^P$ selected by the firm. \n\n::: {#exm-eqm-ext}\nConsider a firm with $\\pi = pq - cq^2$ where $q$ is the output, $p$ is the price of the good and $c>0$ is a constant. Suppose that externality is a linear function of quantity, namely $x=a q,$ with $a >0.$ Hence:\n\n$$\n\\pi(x) = p\\frac{x}{a} - c\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2.\n$$\n\nThe FOC yields:\n$$\nx^P = \\frac{ap}{2c}.\n$$\n\nSuppose that the consumer has a damange function defined by:\n\n$$\nv(x) = b - cx - \\frac{dx^2}{2},\\quad b,d>0.\n$$\nObserve that the marginal cost of the damage increases in the level of pollution. This makes sense intuitively if we think about how health deterioration accelerates as pollution gets worse.\n\nIn view of @eq-FOC-SP, we can determine the Pareto efficient level of externality:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi'(x^E) &= -v'(x^E) \\\\\n\\frac{p}{a}-\\frac{2c}{a^2}x^E &= c+dx^E \\\\\nx^E &= \\frac{ap-a^2c}{2c+ad}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhen is it efficient to have a positive amount of externality, i.e., to have $x^E>0?$ Observe that $v'(0)=-c$ and $\\pi'(0)=p/a$ and $x^E > 0$ if and only if $pa-ca^2 >0,$ which is equivalent to $p/a > c$ or $\\pi'(0)>-v'(0).$ In other words, the economy should generate negative externalities if the marginal benefits of doing so for firms are greater than the marginal costs to consumers at the origin.\n::: \n\n::: {#exm-positive-ext}\n## Positive externalities\nConsider two neighboring countries, $i$ and $j,$ simultaneously choosing the level of investment in recycling activities $x_i.$ The benefit from recycling is given by:\n\n$$\n\\pi_i(x_i,x_j) = (a - 0.5x_i + 0.25x_j)x_i - bx_i,\n$$\n\nwhere $a,b>0.$\n\nIn a competitive equilibrium, country $i$ chooses $x_i$ so as to maximize its own benefit. The optimal conditions provide the best response functions for the firms. In particular:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial{\\pi_i}}{\\partial x_i} = 0\n\\iff x_i &= a - b + \\frac{x_j}{4} \\\\\nBR_i(x_j) &= a - b + \\frac{x_j}{4},\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand likewise for country $j.$\n\nThe NE of this game is:\n$$\nx_i^* = x_j^* = \\frac{4(a - b)}{3}.\n$${#eq-NE-comp}\n\nTo be Pareto optimal, each country considers not only its own benefit but also that of the other country when making a decision. Another way to think about this is to make a decision from the point of view of a social planner who determines both investment levels to maximize joint benefits:\n\n$$\n\\max_{x_i,x_j} \\pi(x_i,x_j) \\equiv \\pi_i(x_i,x_j) + \\pi_j(x_i,x_j).\n$${#eq-pos-ext-SP}\n\nThe FOC condition for country $i$ gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial x_i} &= 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\pi_i(x_i,x_j)}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial \\pi_j(x_i,x_j)}{\\partial x_i} &= 0 \\\\\nx_i &= a - b + \\frac{x_j}{2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nLikewise for country $j:$ \n\n$$\nx_j = a - b \\frac{x_i}{2}.\n$$\n\nHence the best response lines are steeper compared to the competitive case, resulting in higher equilibrium investments.

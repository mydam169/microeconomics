A monopolist can choose any point on the demand curve: choosing the level of output is equivalent to choosing the price at which to sell the good.\n\nA monopoly emerges due to barriers to entry such as:\n\n1.  **Structural barriers**: such as cost advantage or demand advantage of incumbent firms\n2.  **Legal barriers**: such as patents\n3.  **Strategic barriers**: incumbent firms can engage in price wars (matching low prices of competitors) to build reputation as an aggressive competitor and deter entry\n\n## Profit maximizing problem (PMP)\n\nJust as any other firm, the objective of the monopolist is to maximize profits. The quantity supplied in a monopoly is the solution to the monopolist's PMP, which is:\n\n$$\n\\max_q \\pi = R(q) - C(q) = p(q) q - C(q), \n$$ \n\nwhere $p(q)$ is the inverse demand function and $C(q)$ is the firm's total cost. Assuming differentiability, the FOC reads: \n\n$$ \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi'(q) = p(q) + p'(q)q - C'(q) &= 0 \\\\\np(q) + p'(q)q &= C'(q) \\\\\nMR(q) &= MC(q).\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-FOC}\n\nAt the profit maximizing output, the monopolist equalizes marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC).\n\nIn order for the FOC to be sufficient, the SOC needs to be verified, i.e., \n\n$$\n\\pi''(q) = MR'(q) - MC'(q) \\leq 0,\n$$ \n\nmeaning that the slope of the marginal cost curve is greater or equal to that of the marginal revenue curve. This condition is clearly satisfied in the case of downward sloping MR and upward sloping MC (convex cost function).\n\nIf the SOC then the profit maximizing output is such that $MR(q) = MC(q)$ since:\n\n-   If $MR(q) > MC(q)$, raising output increases profits\n-   If $MR(q) < MC(q)$, raising output hurts profits\n\n## Monopolistic outcomes\n\nRecall that for a price-taker, the marginal revenue is the market price. For a monopolist, this is no longer true since the monopolist influences the market price via their output level. In particular, in a monopoly, MR is *less* than the market price whenever the law of demand holds (decreasing demand curve): \n$$ \nMR(q) = p(q) + p'(q)q < p(q).\n$$ {#eq-MR}\n\nHence as output increases, there are two opposing forces acting on the firm's revenue. On the one hand, selling one additional unit yields an additional revenue equal to the price $p(q)$. On the other hand, higher supply depresses the price of the good since the demand curve is downward sloping.\n\nMarginal revenue being less than the price implies that graphically the MR curve lies *below* the demand curve. Notice that the MR curve and the demand curves originate at the same height since $MR(0) = p(0).$ This is the highest price anyone is willing to pay for the good (the maximum willingness to pay or reservation price).\n\n::: {#exm-LinearDemand}\nConsider the linear inverse demand function $p(q) = a - bq$ where $a, b > 0$. The marginal revenue is $RM(q) = R'(q) = a - 2bq,$ which is twice as steep as the demand curve but originates at the same point $(0,a)$ as the demand curve. Suppose the market is a monopoly and the monopolist has constant marginal cost $MC(q)=c,$ then monopolist maximizes profits by selling $q=\\frac{a-c}{2b}$ at the price $p=\\frac{a+c}{2}$. Observe that $a$ measures the highest reservation price, if $a < c$ the market would cease to exist.\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-linDemand fig-cap=\"A monopoly with linear demand and constant marginal cost.

Indeed, monopoly prices depend on the market demand, which is the aggegration of consumers' demand, as we saw previously. The price and quantity combination of the monopolist is constrained by the market demand curve. Since the demand curve is in general downward sloping, in general it is not optimal for the monopolist to set prices as high as possible since as prices increase, the quantity demanded declines.\n\n### The monopolist has a supply curve\n\nThe monopolist does not have a supply curve since it is a price maker. Indeed, recall that the supply curve is constructed by associating each *given price* with a quantity that firms are willing to produce. In a monopoly there is *no given price*: for a monopolist, deciding how much to produce is equivalent to choosing at which price to sell; the two are determined simulatenously via the demand curve.\n\n### The monopolist operates in the inelastic portion of the demand curve\n\nMonopolies tend to emerge in markets with few or no close substitutes where demands are relatively inelastic. It is thus tempting to think that monopolists operate on the part of the demand curve where consumers are most insensitive to a variation in price But this might not be profit maximizing. Suppose the firm is operating on the inelastic portion of the demand curve, this means that price-elasticity of demand is less than one (in absolute value). By reducing the price by 1%, the monopolist increases sales by *more than* 1% thereby increasing revenues. It will then have incentives to raise output (reduce prices) so long as it is on the inelastic part of the demand curve.\n\n::: {#fig-Elasticity fig-cap=\"Going from the left to the right, the demand curve becomes less and less elastic _even if_ its slope is constant.\"}\n```{python}\na = 4\nb = 1\nq = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ndef demand(q):\n    return a - b * q\ndef elas(q):\n    return (-1 / b) * demand(q) / q\ndef rev(q):\n    return demand(q) * q\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\n# elastic demand\nq1 = np.linspace(0, a/(2*b), 50)\nplt.plot(q1, demand(q1), color='green', lw=2, label='Elastic demand')\n# inelastic demand\nq2 = np.linspace(a/(2*b), a/b, 50)\nplt.plot(q2, demand(q2), color='r', lw=2, label='Inelastic demand')\n# elasticity\nplt.plot(q, elas(q), label=\"Price elasticity of demand\")\n# plt.plot(q, demand(q), label=\"Demand $p(q)$\", color='k', lw=1.5)\nplt.plot(q, rev(q), label=\"Revenue $p(q)q$\", color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=-1, xmin=0, xmax=q.max(), linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=0, xmin=0, xmax=q.max(), color='gray', lw=0.5)\nplt.vlines(x=a/(2*b), ymin=-5, ymax=5, color='gray', linestyle='dotted')\n\n\nplt.xlabel('Quantity', loc='right')\nplt.ylabel('Price, Elasticity, Revenue', loc='top')\nplt.ylim([-5, 5])\nplt.xlim([0, a/b])\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([-1, 0])\nplt.grid(None)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n# The Lerner index and the inverse elasticity pricing rule\n\n## Lerner index\n\nThe Lerner index is the ratio between the markup (difference between the price and the marginal cost) and the price.

They coordinate on total output, i.e., agree on the quantity that each member produces, and redistribute joint profits.\n\nHere is another cartel example in the automotive industry. In 2016, several major European truck manufacturers, including Daimler, Volvo/Renault, Iveco, and DAF, were fined by the European Commission for forming a cartel. These companies had colluded for 14 years to fix prices and delay the introduction of more environmentally friendly truck models.

For example, in the context of an excise tax, the distorsion caused by the tax (or the DWL) would be higher the flatter the demand curve.

It is a case of market failure. What can the government do to mitigate the consequences? In general it depends on the type of monopolies. \nA monopoly that arises and persists thanks to economies of scale (decreasing average cost) is called a __natural monopoly__.\n\nIf the monopoly is not a natural monopoly, i.e., if they maintain their dominant position by anticompetitive or restrictive practices (e.g., exclusive dealing, tying, bundling, predatory pricing, etc.), then the general public approach is to try and break them by using antitrust laws.\n\nIf it is a natural monopoly, then the government might attempt to regulate.\nNow the government faces a dilemma since it is more efficient for a single firm to serve the market thanks to economies of scale.\nFor a natural monopoly the average cost is declining in output. Recall that for output levels for which the average cost is declining, the marginal cost is _less_ than the average cost. \nIf the government requires that the natural monopolist sets price equal to the marginal cost as if it were operating in a perfectly competitive market, it would incur a loss since this price would be below its average cost.\n\nOne public solution is to allow natural monopolists to charge different prices to different groups of customers (e.g., different electricity/water rates depending on whether customers are businesses or households) in such a way that the losses incurred would be offset by the positive profits. \n\n# Monopsony\n\n## What is a monopsony?\n\nIn contrast to a monopoly, in a _monopsony_, there is a single buyer and several sellers.

As the labor market becomes scarce, employing an additional worker raises the wage to $w(L)$. The increased wage $w'>0$ must be enjoyed by all the workers, which is captured by the second term. \nAn analogy with the monopoly might help us remember these terms.

A monopolist can choose any point on the demand curve: choosing the level of output is equivalent to choosing the price at which to sell the good.\n\nA monopoly emerges due to barriers to entry such as:\n\n1.  **Structural barriers**: such as cost advantage or demand advantage of incumbent firms\n2.  **Legal barriers**: such as patents\n3.  **Strategic barriers**: incumbent firms can engage in price wars (matching low prices of competitors) to build reputation as an aggressive competitor and deter entry\n\n## Profit maximizing problem (PMP)\n\nJust as any other firm, the objective of the monopolist is to maximize profits. The quantity supplied in a monopoly is the solution to the monopolist's PMP, which is:\n\n$$\n\\max_q \\pi = R(q) - C(q) = p(q) q - C(q), \n$$ \n\nwhere $p(q)$ is the inverse demand function and $C(q)$ is the firm's total cost. Assuming differentiability, the FOC reads: \n\n$$ \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi'(q) = p(q) + p'(q)q - C'(q) &= 0 \\\\\np(q) + p'(q)q &= C'(q) \\\\\nMR(q) &= MC(q).\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-FOC}\n\nAt the profit maximizing output, the monopolist equalizes marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC).\n\nIn order for the FOC to be sufficient, the SOC needs to be verified, i.e., \n\n$$\n\\pi''(q) = MR'(q) - MC'(q) \\leq 0,\n$$ \n\nmeaning that the slope of the marginal cost curve is greater or equal to that of the marginal revenue curve. This condition is clearly satisfied in the case of downward sloping MR and upward sloping MC (convex cost function).\n\nIf the SOC then the profit maximizing output is such that $MR(q) = MC(q)$ since:\n\n-   If $MR(q) > MC(q)$, raising output increases profits\n-   If $MR(q) < MC(q)$, raising output hurts profits\n\n## Monopolistic outcomes\n\nRecall that for a price-taker, the marginal revenue is the market price. For a monopolist, this is no longer true since the monopolist influences the market price via their output level. In particular, in a monopoly, MR is *less* than the market price whenever the law of demand holds (decreasing demand curve): \n$$ \nMR(q) = p(q) + p'(q)q < p(q).\n$$ {#eq-MR}\n\nHence as output increases, there are two opposing forces acting on the firm's revenue. On the one hand, selling one additional unit yields an additional revenue equal to the price $p(q)$. On the other hand, higher supply depresses the price of the good since the demand curve is downward sloping.\n\nMarginal revenue being less than the price implies that graphically the MR curve lies *below* the demand curve. Notice that the MR curve and the demand curves originate at the same height since $MR(0) = p(0).$ This is the highest price anyone is willing to pay for the good (the maximum willingness to pay or reservation price).\n\n::: {#exm-LinearDemand}\nConsider the linear inverse demand function $p(q) = a - bq$ where $a, b > 0$. The marginal revenue is $RM(q) = R'(q) = a - 2bq,$ which is twice as steep as the demand curve but originates at the same point $(0,a)$ as the demand curve. Suppose the market is a monopoly and the monopolist has constant marginal cost $MC(q)=c,$ then monopolist maximizes profits by selling $q=\\frac{a-c}{2b}$ at the price $p=\\frac{a+c}{2}$. Observe that $a$ measures the highest reservation price, if $a < c$ the market would cease to exist.\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-linDemand fig-cap=\"A monopoly with linear demand and constant marginal cost.

Indeed, monopoly prices depend on the market demand, which is the aggegration of consumers' demand, as we saw previously. The price and quantity combination of the monopolist is constrained by the market demand curve. Since the demand curve is in general downward sloping, in general it is not optimal for the monopolist to set prices as high as possible since as prices increase, the quantity demanded declines.\n\n### The monopolist has a supply curve\n\nThe monopolist does not have a supply curve since it is a price maker. Indeed, recall that the supply curve is constructed by associating each *given price* with a quantity that firms are willing to produce. In a monopoly there is *no given price*: for a monopolist, deciding how much to produce is equivalent to choosing at which price to sell; the two are determined simulatenously via the demand curve.\n\n### The monopolist operates in the inelastic portion of the demand curve\n\nMonopolies tend to emerge in markets with few or no close substitutes where demands are relatively inelastic. It is thus tempting to think that monopolists operate on the part of the demand curve where consumers are most insensitive to a variation in price But this might not be profit maximizing. Suppose the firm is operating on the inelastic portion of the demand curve, this means that price-elasticity of demand is less than one (in absolute value). By reducing the price by 1%, the monopolist increases sales by *more than* 1% thereby increasing revenues. It will then have incentives to raise output (reduce prices) so long as it is on the inelastic part of the demand curve.\n\n::: {#fig-Elasticity fig-cap=\"Going from the left to the right, the demand curve becomes less and less elastic _even if_ its slope is constant.\"}\n```{python}\na = 4\nb = 1\nq = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ndef demand(q):\n    return a - b * q\ndef elas(q):\n    return (-1 / b) * demand(q) / q\ndef rev(q):\n    return demand(q) * q\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\n# elastic demand\nq1 = np.linspace(0, a/(2*b), 50)\nplt.plot(q1, demand(q1), color='green', lw=2, label='Elastic demand')\n# inelastic demand\nq2 = np.linspace(a/(2*b), a/b, 50)\nplt.plot(q2, demand(q2), color='r', lw=2, label='Inelastic demand')\n# elasticity\nplt.plot(q, elas(q), label=\"Price elasticity of demand\")\n# plt.plot(q, demand(q), label=\"Demand $p(q)$\", color='k', lw=1.5)\nplt.plot(q, rev(q), label=\"Revenue $p(q)q$\", color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=-1, xmin=0, xmax=q.max(), linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=0, xmin=0, xmax=q.max(), color='gray', lw=0.5)\nplt.vlines(x=a/(2*b), ymin=-5, ymax=5, color='gray', linestyle='dotted')\n\n\nplt.xlabel('Quantity', loc='right')\nplt.ylabel('Price, Elasticity, Revenue', loc='top')\nplt.ylim([-5, 5])\nplt.xlim([0, a/b])\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([-1, 0])\nplt.grid(None)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n# The Lerner index and the inverse elasticity pricing rule\n\n## Lerner index\n\nThe Lerner index is the ratio between the markup (difference between the price and the marginal cost) and the price.

The fines totaled over €2.9 billion, making it one of the largest cartel fines in history.\n:::\n\n# Impacts on welfare\n\nThe following table sums up the impact on welfare of monopolies compared to more competitive markets\n\n::: {#tbl-welfareImpact tbl-cap=\"Impacts of monopolies on welfare\"}\n\n|                        |                                           |\n|:-----------------------|:------------------------------------------|\n| Consumer Surplus       | Lower                                     |\n| Producer Surplus       | Higher                                    |\n| Dead weight loss (DWL) | Higher for monopolies with a unique price |\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {#fig-SD-perfectComp fig-cap=\"Welfare distribution in perfect competition\"}\n```{python}\na, b, c = 6, 1, 0.75\nqmax = a / b\nqRMmax = a / (2 * b)\nqM = a / (c + 2 * b)\nqC = a / (c + b)\n# pM = a * (b + c) / (2 * b + c)\nq = np.linspace(0, qmax, 100)\ndef demand(q):\n    return a - b * q \npM = demand(qM)\npC = demand(qC)\ndef MR(q):\n    return a - 2 * b * q\ndef MC(q):\n    return c * q \ndef TC(q):\n    return 0.5 * c * q**2\ndef AC(q):\n    return TC(q) / q \nplt.plot(q, demand(q), label='$p(q)$', color='k', lw=2)\nplt.plot(q, MR(q), label='$MR(q)$', color='r', lw=1.5)\n# plt.text(-0.3, a, '$a$')\nplt.plot(q, MC(q), label='$MC(q)$', lw=1.5)\n# quantities and prices\nplt.vlines(x=qC, ymin=0, ymax=pC, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=pC, xmin=0, xmax=qC, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.text(qC * 0.95, -0.35, '$q_C$')\nplt.text(-0.4, pC, '$p_C$')\n\nplt.vlines(x=qM, ymin=0, ymax=pM, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=pM, xmin=0, xmax=qM, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.text(qM * 0.95, -0.35, '$q_M$')\nplt.text(-0.4, pM, '$p_M$')\n\n# surplus distribution in PC\nx = np.linspace(0, qC, 100)\npcline = pC * np.ones(len(x))\ndline = demand(x)\nmcline = MC(x)\n# CS\nplt.fill_between(x, dline, pcline, alpha=.25, label='CS')\n# PS\nplt.fill_between(x, pcline, mcline, color='r', alpha=.25, label='PS')\n\nplt.xlim([0, 1.1 * qmax])\nplt.ylim([0, 1.5 * a])\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([])\n# plt.grid(None)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#fig-SDMon fig-cap=\"Welfare distribution in monopoly\"}\n```{python}\nplt.plot(q, demand(q), label='$p(q)$', color='k', lw=2)\nplt.plot(q, MR(q), label='$MR(q)$', color='r', lw=1.5)\n# plt.text(-0.3, a, '$a$')\nplt.plot(q, MC(q), label='$MC(q)$', lw=1.5)\n# quantities and prices\nplt.vlines(x=qC, ymin=0, ymax=pC, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=pC, xmin=0, xmax=qC, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.text(qC * 0.95, -0.35, '$q_C$')\nplt.text(-0.4, pC, '$p_C$')\n\nplt.vlines(x=qM, ymin=0, ymax=pM, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.hlines(y=pM, xmin=0, xmax=qM, linestyle='dotted', color='gray')\nplt.text(qM * 0.95, -0.35, '$q_M$')\nplt.text(-0.4, pM, '$p_M$')\n\n# surplus distribution in monopoly\nx1 = np.linspace(0, qM, 100)\nx2 = np.linspace(qM, qC, 100)\ndline = demand(x1)\npmline = pM * np.ones(len(x1))\ncmline = MC(x1)\n# CS\nplt.fill_between(x1, dline, pmline, alpha=.25, label='CS')\n# PS\nplt.fill_between(x1, pmline, cmline, color='r', alpha=.25, label='PS')\n# DWL\ndline = demand(x2)\ncmline = MC(x2)\nplt.fill_between(x2, dline, cmline, color='gray', alpha=.25, label='DWL')\n\nplt.xlim([0, 1.1 * qmax])\nplt.ylim([0, 1.5 * a])\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([])\n# plt.grid(None)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n@fig-elasticityDWL shows the impact of price-elasticity of demand on the magnitidue of the dead weight loss due to monpoly. The more elastic is the demand curve, the smaller the DWL appears to be. This is because a higher price-elasticity of demand reduces the markup potential of the monopolist, resulting in an outcome that is closer to the perfectly competitive one. In @exr-Lerner-CEdemand, you are asked to show the dependence of DWL on elasticity for the constant-elasticity demand case.

For example, in the context of an excise tax, the distorsion caused by the tax (or the DWL) would be higher the flatter the demand curve. This is because consumers in a market with relatively more elastic demand, consumers have more alternatives which they can turn to rather than continuing to consume the good whose price has increased. \n:::\n\n# Regulation of monopolies\n\nMonopolies cause a reduction in consumer welfare and a loss of market efficiency. It is a case of market failure. What can the government do to mitigate the consequences? In general it depends on the type of monopolies. \nA monopoly that arises and persists thanks to economies of scale (decreasing average cost) is called a __natural monopoly__.\n\nIf the monopoly is not a natural monopoly, i.e., if they maintain their dominant position by anticompetitive or restrictive practices (e.g., exclusive dealing, tying, bundling, predatory pricing, etc.), then the general public approach is to try and break them by using antitrust laws.\n\nIf it is a natural monopoly, then the government might attempt to regulate.\nNow the government faces a dilemma since it is more efficient for a single firm to serve the market thanks to economies of scale.\nFor a natural monopoly the average cost is declining in output. Recall that for output levels for which the average cost is declining, the marginal cost is _less_ than the average cost. \nIf the government requires that the natural monopolist sets price equal to the marginal cost as if it were operating in a perfectly competitive market, it would incur a loss since this price would be below its average cost.\n\nOne public solution is to allow natural monopolists to charge different prices to different groups of customers (e.g., different electricity/water rates depending on whether customers are businesses or households) in such a way that the losses incurred would be offset by the positive profits. \n\n# Monopsony\n\n## What is a monopsony?\n\nIn contrast to a monopoly, in a _monopsony_, there is a single buyer and several sellers. The buyer will be able to pay less for each unit of the good than if it had to compete against other buyers. \n\n::: {#exm-monopsony-quali}\nExamples of a monopsonies abound, spanning from the labor, retail, technology to the public sector. \n\n* **Labor** market: Large factories in remote areas in developing countries might be the sole buyer of labor in the region. These companies can exert significant control over wages and employment conditions.\n\n* **Retail**: Big supermarket chains such as Walmart (US), Carrefour (France) or Amazon (online) might have important negotiating power over suppliers when they are the dominant buyers of certain products.\n\n* **Content platforms** such as YouTube, Instagram or Spotify might have monopsonistic power over content creators\n\n* **Public defense**: In many countries, the government is the sole purchaser of military equipment and defense-related goods. Companies producing such goods often have to accept the terms and prices dictated by the government.\n:::\n\n## Modeling a monopsony\n\nConsider a firm with production function $q=f(L)$ which is twice differentiable, strictly increasing ($f'>0$) and strictly concave ($f''<0$)\nThe firm faces only linear labor cost $w(L)L$ and its profits are given by:\n$$\n\\pi = pq - w(L)L, \n$$\nwhere $p$ is the price of the good produced by the firm\n\nNote that $w$ is increasing in $L$: the higher demand for labor, the higher the wage. In other words, the firm is not a price-taker in the labor market: it has influences over the wage by deciding on the number of workers to hire.\n\nThe monopsonist's PMP:\n$$\n\\max_{L\\geq 0} \\pi =pq - w(L)L = pf(L) - w(L)L.\n$$\n\nDifferentiating w.r.t $L$ yields:\n$$\n\\pi'(L) = 0 \\iff pf'(L) = w(L) + w'(L)L.\n$${#eq-FOC_monopsony}\n    \nObserve that the LHS of @eq-FOC_monopsony represents the marginal revenue brought about but an additional worker ($f'$ is the marginal output).\nIt is often referred to as the **marginal revenue product** of labor ($MRP$). \n    \nThe RHS of @eq-FOC_monopsony captures the marginal cost or the **marginal expenditure** on labor ($ME$). As the labor market becomes scarce, employing an additional worker raises the wage to $w(L)$. The increased wage $w'>0$ must be enjoyed by all the workers, which is captured by the second term. \nAn analogy with the monopoly might help us remember these terms. In particular:\n\n* $w(L)$ to $p(q)$: Supply to demand\n* $ME(L)$ to $MR(q)$: Marginal expenditure to marginal revenue\n* $MRP(L)$ to $MC(q)$. Marginal revenue product to marginal cost\n\nLet us look at a numerical example.\n\n::: {#exm-monop-Quant}\nConsider a coal mine in a small town with production function $q = 30\\ln L$. The market for coal is a perfectly competitive one with price $p=\\$5$ per unit. The labor market where the mine operates has supply given by $w(L) = 5 + \\frac{1}{2}L.$ Determine the number of workers hired and the equilibrium wage in this market.\n\nThe monopsony's PMP:\n$$ \n\\pi(L) = 150\\ln(L) - (5 + \\frac{1}{2}L)L,\n$$\n\nwhich is strictly concave in $L.$ The necessary and sufficient condition for a max is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi'(L) = 0 \\iff \\frac{150}{L} &= 5 + L \\\\\nL^2 + 5L - 150 &= 0 \\\\\nL &= 10.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n    \nHence the optimal number of hires is 26 for a wage rate of $w(10) = \\$10.$\n\nIf the market were competitive, the firm would have taken the wage as given while soving its PMP. The condition for a max in this case would have been:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\npq'(L) &= w(L) \\\\\n\\frac{150}{L} &= 5 + \\frac{1}{2}L \\\\\nL &= -5 + \\sqrt{325} \\approx 13.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe competitive wage would have been $w(13)=11.5.$\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-monopsony-DWL fig-cap='Consequences of monopsony'}\n\n```{python}\nL = np.linspace(.1, 40, 500)\nLm = 10\nLc = -5 + np.sqrt(325)\n\ndef ME(L):\n    return 5 + L\ndef MRP(L):\n    return 150 / L\ndef wage(L):\n    return 5 + 0.5 * L\nwm = wage(Lm)\nwc = wage(Lc)\nplt.plot(L, MRP(L), label='$MRP(L)$')\nplt.plot(L, ME(L), label='$ME(L)$', color='r', lw=1.5)\nplt.plot(L, wage(L), label='$w(L)$', color='k', lw=1.5)\n\nplt.vlines(x=Lm, ymin=0, ymax=ME(Lm), linestyle='--', color='gray', lw=.5)\nplt.vlines(x=Lc, ymin=0, ymax=wc, linestyle='--', color='gray', lw=.5)\nplt.hlines(y=wm, xmin=0, xmax=Lm, linestyle='--', color='gray', lw=.5)\nplt.hlines(y=wc, xmin=0, xmax=Lc, linestyle='--', color='gray', lw=.5)\n\nplt.text(Lm * 0.9, -1, '$L_M$')\nplt.text(Lc * 0.95, -1, '$L_C$')\nplt.text(-3, wm, '$w_M$')\nplt.text(-3, wc, '$w_C$')\n\n# shading DWL\nx = np.linspace(Lm, Lc, 50)\nabove = MRP(x)\nbelow = wage(x)\nplt.fill_between(x, above, below, color='gray', alpha=.25, label='$DWL$')\n\nplt.ylim([0, 25])\nplt.xlim([0, 40])\n\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.yticks([])\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n```\n:::\n\nTo conclude, we see that compared to a competitive buyer, the monopsonist buys a lower quantity at a lower price and this creates a dead weight loss in the market, as in the case of the monopoly.\n\n\n# Exercises\n\n::: {#exr-elasticityD}\nConsider a market with a linear demand curve $p(q) = a - bq,$ where $a$ and $b$ are strictly positive constants.

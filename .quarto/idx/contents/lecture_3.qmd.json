We shall begin by deriving the market supply curve, which results from firms' optimal production decision. Likewise, market demand results from consumers' optimal consumption decision. Searching for an equilibrium is essentially searching for prices that equalize demand and supply in the market. When a single market is considered in isolation, its equilibrium is a partial one. When all markets are considered, we speak of a general equilibrium. In a pure exchange economy, all markets are markets of consumption goods. In  a production economy, the relevant markets include those of factors of production such as labor, capital and land. In this course, we will be mostly interested in general equilibria in a pure exchange economy. \n\n\nOur markets in this chapter are perfectly competitive, their features are:\n\n* Fragmentation: large number of producers and consumers whose decisions (to produce or consume) do not influence market prices of the goods. In other words, all market participants are price-takers\n\n* Undifferentiated products: products of all firms in the same industry are regarded as identical by consumers\n\n* Perfect information: information on prices are transparent and freely accessible by consumers\n\n* Free entry and exit: in the long run (LR), firms can freely enter and exit \n\nExample: Wheat, corn, or agricultural commodities\n\n# Firm's profit maxmimization problem (PMP)\n\n## The PMP\n\n<!-- * Is the dual problem of the cost minimization problem (CMP) introduced previously\n    * In that problem, we implicitly assumed that firms were price-takers in the markets of inputs -->\n\n::: {#def-PMP}\n## Firm's PMP\nConsider a price-taking firm in the market of the output good\nGiven $p$, the market price of the good, every firm's PMP is:\n$$\n\\max_{q\\geq 0} \\pi = R(q) - C(q) = pq - C(q), \n$$\nwhere $C(q)$ is the total cost function derived from the CMP introduced previously, $R(q)$ denotes the total revenue. \n:::\n    \nObserve that the PMP includes the CMP as a first step\n\n## Necessary conditions\n\nAccording to the KT conditions, either \n\n* we have a corner solution $q=0$, or\n\n* We have an interior solution $q>0$ satisfying the FOC:\n\n    $$\n        \\pi'(q) = 0 \\iff p = C'(q) \\\\\n        \\iff p = MC(q).\n    $$\n    \n* Observe that for a price-taking firm, the marginal revenue is the market price of the good (as we shall see later, for a firm with market power, the marginal revenue is _less_ than the price)\n\n* The FOC above implies that the firm produces up to a point where the marginal revenue (marginal benefit) is equal to the marginal cost. \n    \n## Sufficient condition\n\n* The FOC is sufficient for a max if the profit function is concave  in output. This is called the second-order condition (SOC)\n\n* We have:\n\n    $$ \n    \\pi''(q) = -C''(q), \n    $$\n    \n    implying that the SOC is satisfied if the cost function is convex in $q$ (i.e., if the MC is increasing in output)\n\n\n    \n## Examples\n\n::: {#exm-ESCex}\nLet us solve the PMP of a price-taking firm in the output market (and inputs market). Assume that it has a Cobb-Douglas production function defined by $q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2}$. The factor prices are $w=\\$40$ and $r=\\$10$ as before.\n\n* Step 1: Solve the CMP:\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    &\\min_{K,L} 40L + 10K \\\\\n    \\text{s.t. } &q(L, K) = L^{1/2}K^{1/2} \\geq q, \n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n    \n    for some target output level $q$. \n    \n    * The cost function can be obtained by replacing the solutions of the CMP into the objective function. This yields: \n    \n    $$\n    C(q) = 40q. \n    $$\n\n\n* Step 2: Substitute $C(q)$ obtained from the CMP into the PMP so that this problem reads:\n\n    $$\n    \\max_{q\\geq0} \\pi(q) = pq - 40q = (p - 40)q. \n    $$\n    \n    * Clearly if $p<40$ the firm should shut down\n    \n    * If $p\\geq 40$, the firm produces as much as possible since the profit is then incresing in output\n    \n    * We thus obtain a perfectly elastic individual supply curve\n\n    * Note that this is the long-run individual supply curve since all inputs are variable. One can also verify that the long-run cost function does not have a fixed cost. \n\n::: {#fig-PEScurve fig-cap=\"A perfectly elastic long-run supply curve\"}\n```{python}\nq = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)\np = np.ones(len(q)) * 40\nplt.plot(q, p, lw=2)\nplt.vlines(x=0, ymin=0, ymax=40, lw=2)\nplt.xlabel('Quantity ($q$)', loc='right')\nplt.ylabel('Price ($p$)', loc='top')\nplt.ylim([0, 60])\nplt.xticks([0])\nplt.yticks([40])\nplt.grid(False)\nplt.show()\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-linearSC}\nSuppose we have obtained a convex cost function for the firm of the form:\n$$\nC(q) = 0.5 a q^2 + bq + c, \n$$\nwhere $a$, $b$ and $c$ are strictly positive constants. Observe that this is a short-run cost function since fixed costs ($c$) are present. \nThe profit maximizing condition for the firm is:\n$$\nC'(q) = a q + b = p \\iff q = \\frac{p - b}{a}. \n$${#eq-optimal-SR-supply}\n\nTo determine the short-run supply curve of the firm, we need to understand the nature of the fixed costs represented by $c.$ In the short-run, firms are typically do not try to make positive profits, i.e., they do not need to sell each unit for at least their average total cost. Firms only need to recuperate the non-sunk part of the fixed cost. __Sunk__ costs are fixed costs that cannot be recovered by the firm and thus should not affect its decision on future output. For example, advertising costs once spent cannot be recovered. Lease payments, on the other hand, are __non-sunk__ fixed costs can be recovered by sublease if the firm eventually decides to shut down.\n\nFor simplicity, suppose that $c$ is non-sunk. The average total cost in this case is equal to the average non-sunk total cost (ANSC).The firm produces so long as the market price is above the ANSC:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(q^*) > 0 &\\iff p > \\frac{C(q^*)}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p > 0.5 a q^* + b + \\frac{c}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p > 0.5 a \\frac{p - b}{a} + b + \\frac{ca}{p - b} \\\\\n&\\iff (p - b)^2 > 2ca \\\\\n&\\iff p > b + \\sqrt{2ca}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-positive-prof-cond}\n\nObserve that the last line follows from the fact that $q^* > 0$ if and only if $p > b$ in view of @eq-optimal-SR-supply. This condition tells us that in the SR, the firm suffers from a fixed cost ($c$), which might prevent it from earning positive profits even if it is operating optimally.

In other words, the equilibrium price is the price that clears the market by equating demand and supply. We have already discussed the market demand curve in the first lecture. We now examine the supply side of the market for which there exists differences between the long run and the short run. \n\n## Short-run equilibrium\n\nIn the short run, the market supply curve is an horizontal aggregation of individual supplies. In other words, to construct the SR market supply curve, one adds up the quantities supplied by all the firms in the market at each given price. The market demand curve is constructed in the same manner. By equating supply and demand, we can determine the market equilibrium.\n\n::: {#exm-SREQ}\nSuppose the market demand is given by $q^D(p) = 100 - 2p.$ Consider a market with $N$ identical firms, each facing the same cost function $C(q)=10−5q+2q^2.$\nIn view of @exr-SRSupply, the SR market supply is given by:\n$$\nq^S(p) =\n\\begin{cases} N(p/4 + 5/4) & p > 4\\sqrt{2.5}-5\\approx 1.32 \\\\\n                     0 & \\mathrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIn equilibrium $q^S(p) = q^D(p)$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n100 - 2p &= N(p/4 + 5/4) \\\\\np &= \\frac{5(80 - N)}{8 + N}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nHence the market price is a decreasing function of the number of firms. Knowing the shutdown price, we can determine the maximum number of firms that can exist in this market:\n$$\n\\frac{5(80 - N)}{8 + N} = 1.32 \\iff N = 61.6.\n$$\n:::\n\nThe short-run equilibrium quantity is:\n\n$$\nq^* = 100 - 2p^* = \\frac{110N}{8 + N}, \\quad N \\leq 61.\n$$\n\nHence given the number of firms in the market, we can determine its SR supply curve, which together with the market demand curve defines the equilibrium price and quantity. The market shuts down if $N$ is too large.\n\n## Long-run equilibrium\n\nIn a competitive market, firms can freely enter or exit. If there is an opportunity to make __economic profits__ in a market, firms will enter, pushing down market prices and drive away profits. Note that making profits does not imply making economic profits. Economic profits take into account the opportunity cost of the firm. For instance, if leaving money in a bank earns an interest of 5% per month and the firm is generating less than 5% return on investment, it is not making economic profits even though it is making profits. A long-run equilibrium is reached when the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. Every firm is maximizing profits: $p=MC(q)$\n2. Each firm makes zero economic profits: $p=AC(q)$\n    * This means that firms make the same profits in other competitive markets (hence no incentives for other firms to enter or for existing firms to exit)\n3. Market demand equal to LR market supply\n    * $q^S(p) = q^D(p)$\n\nHence in a LR equilibrium, firms are doing the best they can do in the market which they have no incentives to leave and no other firms have incentives to enter because of zero economic profits, and the price is such that supply is equal to demand. \n\n::: {exm-LRPartialEQM}\nConsider a perfectly competitive industry populated by identical firms with the cost function $C(q)=10 - 5q + 2q^2$. We would like to determine the long-run equilibrium of the market as well as the equilibrium number of firms operating in it.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Note that we are given a short-run cost function, which has a fixed cost, but we would like to determine the market equilibrium in the long run.\n\nDenote the LR equilibrium quantity, price and market size $q^*$, $p^*$ and $N^*$, respectively.\n\n* Since each firm in the market sets $MC(q_i^*) = AC(q_i^*)$:\n    $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    -5 + 4 q^*_i &= \\frac{10}{q_i^*} - 5 + 2 q_i^* \\\\\n    q_i^* &= \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24.\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n    \n* Since $MC(q_i^*) = p^*$, we can deduce the LR equilibrium market price:\n    $$ \n    p^* = -5 + 4 q^*_i = -5 + 4 \\sqrt{5} \\approx 3.94 \n    $$\n    \n* Equilibirum quantity can be found using the market demand equation:\n    $$ \n    q^* = 100 - 2p^* \\approx 92.11 \n    $$\n    \n* The number of active firms in the LR:\n    $$ \n    N^* = \\frac{q^*}{q_i^*} \\approx 41.19 \n    $$\n\n* Hence in the LR equilibrium, the price will be about $\\$3.94$ per unit.

Firms only need to recuperate the non-sunk part of the fixed cost. __Sunk__ costs are fixed costs that cannot be recovered by the firm and thus should not affect its decision on future output. For example, advertising costs once spent cannot be recovered. Lease payments, on the other hand, are __non-sunk__ fixed costs can be recovered by sublease if the firm eventually decides to shut down.\n\nFor simplicity, suppose that $c$ is non-sunk. The average total cost in this case is equal to the average non-sunk total cost (ANSC).The firm produces so long as the market price is above the ANSC:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi(q^*) > 0 &\\iff p > \\frac{C(q^*)}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p > 0.5 a q^* + b + \\frac{c}{q^*} \\\\\n&\\iff p > 0.5 a \\frac{p - b}{a} + b + \\frac{ca}{p - b} \\\\\n&\\iff (p - b)^2 > 2ca \\\\\n&\\iff p > b + \\sqrt{2ca}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-positive-prof-cond}\n\nObserve that the last line follows from the fact that $q^* > 0$ if and only if $p > b$ in view of @eq-optimal-SR-supply. This condition tells us that in the SR, the firm suffers from a fixed cost ($c$), which might prevent it from earning positive profits even if it is operating optimally.

In other words, the equilibrium price is the price that clears the market by equating demand and supply. We have already discussed the market demand curve in the first lecture. We now examine the supply side of the market for which there exists differences between the long run and the short run. \n\n## Short-run equilibrium\n\nIn the short run, the market supply curve is an horizontal aggregation of individual supplies. In other words, to construct the SR market supply curve, one adds up the quantities supplied by all the firms in the market at each given price. The market demand curve is constructed in the same manner. By equating supply and demand, we can determine the market equilibrium.\n\n::: {#exm-SREQ}\nSuppose the market demand is given by $q^D(p) = 100 - 2p.$ Consider a market with $N$ identical firms, each facing the same cost function $C(q)=10−5q+2q^2.$\nIn view of @exr-SRSupply, the SR market supply is given by:\n$$\nq^S(p) =\n\\begin{cases} N(p/4 + 5/4) & p > 4\\sqrt{2.5}-5\\approx 1.32 \\\\\n                     0 & \\mathrm{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIn equilibrium $q^S(p) = q^D(p)$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n100 - 2p &= N(p/4 + 5/4) \\\\\np &= \\frac{5(80 - N)}{8 + N}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nHence the market price is a decreasing function of the number of firms. Knowing the shutdown price, we can determine the maximum number of firms that can exist in this market:\n$$\n\\frac{5(80 - N)}{8 + N} = 1.32 \\iff N = 61.6.\n$$\n:::\n\nThe short-run equilibrium quantity is:\n\n$$\nq^* = 100 - 2p^* = \\frac{110N}{8 + N}, \\quad N \\leq 61.\n$$\n\nHence given the number of firms in the market, we can determine its SR supply curve, which together with the market demand curve defines the equilibrium price and quantity. The market shuts down if $N$ is too large.\n\n## Long-run equilibrium\n\nIn a competitive market, firms can freely enter or exit. If there is an opportunity to make __economic profits__ in a market, firms will enter, pushing down market prices and drive away profits. Note that making profits does not imply making economic profits. Economic profits take into account the opportunity cost of the firm. For instance, if leaving money in a bank earns an interest of 5% per month and the firm is generating less than 5% return on investment, it is not making economic profits even though it is making profits. A long-run equilibrium is reached when the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. Every firm is maximizing profits: $p=MC(q)$\n2. Each firm makes zero economic profits: $p=AC(q)$\n    * This means that firms make the same profits in other competitive markets (hence no incentives for other firms to enter or for existing firms to exit)\n3. Market demand equal to LR market supply\n    * $q^S(p) = q^D(p)$\n\nHence in a LR equilibrium, firms are doing the best they can do in the market which they have no incentives to leave and no other firms have incentives to enter because of zero economic profits, and the price is such that supply is equal to demand. \n\n::: {exm-LRPartialEQM}\nConsider a perfectly competitive industry populated by identical firms with the cost function $C(q)=10 - 5q + 2q^2$.

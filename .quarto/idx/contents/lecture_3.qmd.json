We shall begin by deriving the market supply curve, which results from firms' optimal production decision. Likewise, market demand results from consumers' optimal consumption decision. Searching for an equilibrium is essentially searching for prices that equalize demand and supply in the market. When a single market is considered in isolation, its equilibrium is a partial one. When all markets are considered, we speak of a general equilibrium. In a pure exchange economy, all markets are markets of consumption goods. In  a production economy, the relevant markets include those of factors of production such as labor, capital and land. In this course, we will be mostly interested in general equilibria in a pure exchange economy. \n\n\nOur markets in this chapter are perfectly competitive, their features are:\n\n* Fragmentation: large number of producers and consumers whose decisions (to produce or consume) do not influence market prices of the goods.

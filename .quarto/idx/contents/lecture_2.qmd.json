We denote the production function by $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}_+$, where $n$ is the number of inputs. In the case of two inputs, capital ($K$) and labor ($L$):\n$$\nq = f(K, L),\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the amount of output.\n\n::: {#exm-prodFun}\n1.

Linear production function: $q = aK + bL$ where $a, b > 0.$ Here inputs are perfectly substitutable (e.g., robots vs human workers in the future)\n4. Quasilinear production function: $q = AK^a + bL$ where $A, a, b>0.$ This production function could be used to capture different returns to scales of different inputs. For example scaling is quite straightforward for labor or raw materials but might be complex for capital and land. \n5.

Leontief production function: $q = A\\min\\{aK, bL\\}$, where $A, a, b>0.$ This production function captures the idea that inputs must be used in fixed proportion\n3. Linear production function: $q = aK + bL$ where $a, b > 0.$ Here inputs are perfectly substitutable (e.g., robots vs human workers in the future)\n4. Quasilinear production function: $q = AK^a + bL$ where $A, a, b>0.$ This production function could be used to capture different returns to scales of different inputs. For example scaling is quite straightforward for labor or raw materials but might be complex for capital and land. \n5.
